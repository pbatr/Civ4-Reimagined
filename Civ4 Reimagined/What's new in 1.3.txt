Civ4 Reimagined 1.3
*******************************************

*********
New
*********
-Two new ships: Marauder (Navigation) and Pirate (Guilds). They are weaker than their military counterparts, but bear no markings of nationality. This allows for some early game naval harassing and makes the early naval game more engaging in general
-Two new(ish) medieval technologies: Crop Rotation (Farms spread irrigation; Floating Gardens; Agrarianism) and Civil Service (Longbowman, Crossbowman, Bureaucracy). They are intended to smoothen out some bumps in technology costs
-National building: Great Harbor (Refrigeration; +1 [P] from water tiles)
-Slaves can be acquired by conquering or razing enemy cities when having Slavery as a civic. There exists a threshold of population points you have to conquer before gaining a Slave. The threshold increases with every Slave.

*********
Changes
*********
-Update to K-Mod version 1.45
-Archers and Longbowman gain additional defense bonuses from defensive buildings such as Walls and Castles. Otherwise offensive units with higher ST would benefit more from Walls/Castles than dedicated city defenders, making balancing them tricky. Increased costs to compensate
-Scouts and Explorers cannot enter rival territory
-Chance of destroying buildings when bombarding cities halved
-Naval changes (see also: New pirate ships)
*-Wooden ships gain double production from chopping. This bonus is not applied to overflow production when unit is finished in the same turn.

*-AI is more likely to research stronger ships when cities are plundered by pirates
*-Improved AI for building ships in general
*-Viking Longships are Pirates with improved trade blockade ability
*-Ships with hidden nationality now get the same movement penalty when entering enemy territory during war times
-Military units only count towards reducing unhappiness in a city ("We demand military protection!") when they are at most 2 eras behind your current era. Also, they no longer reduce unhappiness in other player's cities
-Classical Temples get converted to state religion temples when adopting a state religion
-Modified resource ratios: Worse ratios during Middle Ages / Renaissance, better ratios later in the game
-Units with hidden nationality no longer contribute to a civ's power value
