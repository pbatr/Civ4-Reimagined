		<English>[H1]Harun al-Rashid[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]5th Abbasid Caliph[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]763 - 809[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2]Harun al-Rashid was the fifth and most famous of the Abbasid Caliphs, he was born near present day Tehran to al-Mahdi the Caliph of the Abbasid Empire and a slave girl from Yemen.  While his mother came from quite humble beginnings she was very influential during the reign of her husband and for much of Harun's reign.  Born into his position, Harun had developed quite an egotistical and arrogant attitude, however he was an apt and capable ruler.  he began his reign by appointing very able ministers who were able to greatly improve the condition of his people.  It was under Harun that Baghdad flourished into the most splendid city of its period, Harun's focus was on architecture, the arts adn a luxurious life at court.  Harun gave great encouragement to learning, poetry and music.  He was a scholar and poet himself and whenever he heard of learned men in his Empire, or in neighboring countries, he invited them to his court and treated them with great respect, regardless of their nationality or religious beliefs.  He was known worldwide, he had diplomatic relations from Charlemagne's court in Europe to the farthest reaches of China.  Harun is widely considered the greatest of the Abbasid caliphs, presiding over the Arab Empire at its political and cultural zenith.  Consequently, Islamic literature has raised him to the level of an ideal figure, a great military and intellectual leader, even a paragon for future rulers to emulate.  His best-known portrayal in the West, in the stories of the Thousand and One Nights, has little basis in historical fact, but does show the mythic stature he has attained over time.</English>

		<English>[H1]Sejong the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Fourth ruler of the Joseon Dynasty[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1397 - 1450[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2]Sejong the Great, born Yi Do, was the fourth ruler of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea from 1418 to 1450. He was also a skilled linguist who apparently personally created the native Korean alphabet Hangul. Although there are circumstantial clues he may have been assisted by family members, most believe that he was the one who actually invented the alphabet, mainly due to the resistance he faced from the intellectuals of the day.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sejong is also credited with the invention of a rain gauge, striking water clocks, and a sundial. Following the principles of Neo-Confucianism, Sejong was also a humanitarian who proclaimed that there must be three trials before a final judgment is reached, and he prohibited brutality in the punishment of criminals, such as flogging.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was an effective military planner. During his era, his army invaded Tsushima to reduce and eliminate heavy Japanese pirate activities along the southern coast line. On the northern border, he established 4 forts and 6 posts to safeguard his people from the hostile nomads living in Manchuria. He also created various military regulations and units to strengthen the safety of his kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sejong was the third son of King Taejong. When he was ten, he became Grand Prince Chungnyeong and married a daughter of Sim On of Cheongsong, commonly known as Sim-ssi, who later was given the title Princess-Consort Soheon.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sejong established the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon) in 1420 in the royal palace, Sejong gathered intellectuals from around Korea. The scholars of the Hall of Worthies documented history, drafted documents and compiled books on various topics. Sejong's writings are also a highly regarded. He composed the famous Yongbi Eocheon Ga ("Songs of Flying Dragons", 1445), Seokbo Sangjeol ("Episodes from the Life of Buddha", July 1447), Worin Cheon-gang Jigok ("Songs of the Moon Shining on a Thousand Rivers", July 1447), and the reference Dongguk Jeong-un ("Dictionary of Proper Sino-Korean Pronunciation", September 1447). Sejong died at the age of 52 and was buried at the Yeong Mausoleum. His successor was his first son, Munjong.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sejongno (a street) and the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts both located in central Seoul are named after King Sejong, and he is depicted on the South Korean 10,000 Won note.</English>

		<English>[H1]Jayavarman VII[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of the Khmer Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1125 - 1215[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1] Jayavarman VII was born around 1120 or 1125, son of King Dharanindravarman II (r. 1150 - 1160) and queen Sri Jayarajacudamani. He married a very religious, strong-minded, and devote princess, Jayarajadevi, who exerted an important influence on him, both before he gained the throne and during the early years of his reign. He was one of the most forceful and productive kings of the Khmer Empire of Angkor. He expanded the empire to its greatest territorial extent and engaged in a building program that yielded numerous temple, highways, rest houses, and hospitals.[PARAGRAPH:1] Though practically nothing is known of Jayavarman's childhood and youth, it is clear that during his late 30s and early 40s he settled in the neighboring kingdom of Champa, in what is now the central region of Vietnam. When his father died, his brother or cousin - Yasovarman - appears to have claimed the throne, in which Jayavarman seems to renounce and to have gone on a voluntary exile to Champa. He left his wife and went to Champa alone. In 1166 Tribhuvanadityavarman, a court official, usurped the throne of King Yasovarman. When Prince Jayavarman received word of a palace rebellion, he hastened to return to Cambodia - perhaps to support King Yasovarman II or to assert his own rights to the throne. But his was too late. When he arrived, Yasovarman was already dead and the usurper firmly seated on the throne. Jayavarman seemed unwilling to attempt to overthrow Tribhuvanadityavarman by force; instead he decided to remain in his homeland and to await an opportunity to assert his own claim to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1] Some 12 years later, when Jayavarman was in his late 50s, that opportunity came as a result of a Cham invasion in 1177, which brought about the demise of Tribhuvanadityavarman, the sacking of Angkor, and its subjection to foreign rule. In this situation Jayavarman organized a struggle for independence and in less than five years he succeeded in driving out the invaders and establishing his hegemony over all his Cambodian rivals. Finally in 1181, at the age of 61, he was crowned a sole king of Khmer Empire and began a brilliant reign of more than 30 years, during which he brought the empire to its zenith, both in terms of territorial expansion and of royal architecture and construction.[PARAGRAPH:1] Jayavarman VII was a warrior. The greatest military achievement of his reign - perhaps the greatest of the entire history of Cambodia - was the capture and sack of the capital of its rich and powerful neighbor, Champa, in 1190. His military activities also bringing southern Laos, portions of the Malay Peninsula and Burma under his control. But increasingly he devoted his energies and organizational capacities to the kind of religious and religio-political construction projects that had been carried on by his royal predecessors. He built a large number of awesome new temples, including the Bayon, a distinctively Mahayana Buddhist central pyramid temple designed to serve as the primary locus of the royal cult and also as his own personal mausoleum; personal funerary temples of the Mahayana type, which were dedicated to his mother and father; and a series of provincial temples, which housed reduced replicas of the Royal Buddha. He rebuilt the city of Angkor Thom and rebuilt and extended the system of highways, which radiated outward from the Bayon and the royal palace and reached far into the provinces. In addition, he constructed 121 rest houses along these roads. During his reign, the King built 102 hospitals, which he dispersed throughout his kingdom. Those hospitals were built in an attempt to improve conditions of the King's subject.[PARAGRAPH:1] Jayavarman succeeded during his lifetime in creating a legacy that few monarchs in Khmer history have been able to equal. He was more than 90 years old when he died in around 1215.</English>
