The Greek general Xenophon (430?354 BC), an eyewitness at the battle of Cunaxa, tells of them: "These had thin scythes extending at an angle from the axles and also under the driver's seat, turned toward the ground". Serrated bronze blades for chariot wheels have also been excavated from Chou-era pre-imperial Chinese sites.[PARAGRAPH:1]The scythed chariot was pulled by a team of four horses and manned by a crew of up to three men, one driver and two warriors. Theoretically the scythed chariot would plow through infantry lines, cutting combatants in half or at least opening gaps in the line which could be exploited.</English>

It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was controversially named after President Herbert Hoover.[PARAGRAPH:1]A total of 3,250,000 cubic yards (2,480,000 cubic metre) of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935. In addition, 1,110,000 cu yd (850,000 cubic metre) were used in the power plant and other works. More than 582 miles (937 km) of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete. Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956. The average has been about 4.2 TWh/year.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the West and East from China to the Mediterranean Sea. [NEWLINE][TAB]The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in Chinese silk carried out along its length, beginning during the Han dynasty (207 BCE - 220 CE). The Central Asian sections of the trade routes were expanded around 114 BCE by the Han dynasty, largely through the missions and explorations of the Chinese imperial envoy, Zhang Qian. The Chinese took great interest in the safety of their trade products and extended the Great Wall of China to ensure the protection of the trade route.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the civilizations of China, the Indian subcontinent, Persia, Europe, the Horn of Africa and Arabia, opening long-distance, political and economic relations between the civilizations. Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, many other goods were traded, and religions, syncretic philosophies, and various technologies, as well as diseases, also travelled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The United East Indian Company was originally established as a chartered company in 1602, when the Dutch government granted it a 21-year monopoly on Dutch spice trade. It is often considered to have been the first multinational corporation in the world and it was the first company to issue stock. It was a powerful company, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asia trade. Between 1602 and 1796 the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]Having been set up in 1602, to profit from the Malukan spice trade, in 1619 the VOC established a capital in the port city of Jayakarta and changed the city name into Batavia (now Jakarta). Over the next two centuries the Company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. It remained an important trading concern and paid an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years. Weighed down by corruption in the late 18th century, the Company went bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1800, its possessions and the debt being taken over by the government of the Dutch Batavian Republic. The VOC's territories became the Dutch East Indies and were expanded over the course of the 19th century to include the whole of the Indonesian archipelago, and in the 20th century would form the Republic of Indonesia.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Originally known as the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa, by its charter issued in 1660 it was granted a monopoly over English trade with West Africa. With the help of the army and navy, it established forts on the West African coast that served as staging and trading stations and was responsible for seizing any English ships that attempted to operate in violation of the company's monopoly. In the prize court, the King received half of the proceeds and the company half.[NEWLINE][TAB]The company fell heavily into debt in 1667, during the war with the Netherlands, the very war it had itself started when its Admiral Robert Holmes had attacked the Dutch African trade posts in 1664, as it had lost most of its forts on the African coast except for Cape Corse. For several years after that, the company maintained some desultory trade, including licensing single-trip private traders, but its biggest effort was the creation in 1668 of the Gambia Adventurers, a new company separately subscribed and granted a ten-year license for African trade north of the Bight of Benin with effect from 1 January 1669. In 1672, the original Company re-emerged, re-structured and with a new charter from the king, as the new Royal African Company. Its new charter was broader than the old one and included the right to set up forts and factories, maintain troops and exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade in gold, silver and slaves. At the end of 1678, the license to the Gambia Adventurers expired and its Gambian trade was merged into the company.</English>

		<English>[TAB]In economics, a luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally as income rises, and is a contrast to a "necessity good", for which demand increases proportionally less than income. Luxury goods are often synonymous with superior goods and veblen goods. Though often verging on the meaningless in modern marketing, "luxury" remains a legitimate and current technical term in art history for objects that are especially highly decorated to very high standards and use expensive materials. The term is especially used for medieval manuscripts to distinguish between practical working books for normal use, and fully illuminated manuscripts, that were often bound in treasure bindings with metalwork and jewels. These are often much larger, with less text on each page and many illustrations, and if liturgical texts were originally usually kept on the altar or sacristy rather any library that the church or monastery who owned them may have had. Secular luxury manuscripts were commissioned by the very wealthy and differed in the same ways from cheaper books. "Luxury" may be used for other applied arts where both utilitarian and luxury versions of the same types of objects were made. This might cover metalwork, ceramics, glass, arms and armour, and a wide range of objects. It is much less used for objects with no function beyond being an artwork: paintings, drawings and sculpture, even though the disparity in cost between an expensive and cheap work may have been as large.[PARAGRAPH:1]Luxury goods are said to have high income elasticity of demand: as people become wealthier, they will buy more and more of the luxury good. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income its demand will drop. Income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income, and may change sign at different levels of income. That is to say, a luxury good may become a normal good or even an inferior good at different income levels, e.g. a wealthy person stops buying increasing numbers of luxury cars for his automobile collection to start collecting airplanes (at such an income level, the luxury car would become an inferior good). Some luxury products have been claimed to be examples of Veblen goods, with a positive price elasticity of demand: for example, making a perfume more expensive can increase its perceived value as a luxury good to such an extent that sales can go up, rather than down.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The four key drivers of the Industrial Revolution were textile manufacturing, iron founding, steam power and cheap labour. Before the 18th century, the manufacture of cloth was performed by individual workers, in the premises in which they lived and goods were transported around the country by packhorses or by river navigations and contour-following canals that had been constructed in the early 18th century. In the mid-18th century, artisans were inventing ways to become more productive. Silk, wool, and fustian fabrics were being eclipsed by cotton which became the most important textile. Innovations in carding and spinning enabled by advances in cast iron technology resulted in the creation of larger spinning mules and water frames. The machinery was housed in water-powered mills on streams. The need for more power stimulated the production of steam-powered beam engines, and rotative mill engines transmitting the power to line shafts on each floor of the mill. Surplus power capacity encouraged the construction of more sophisticated power looms working in weaving sheds. The scale of production in the mill towns round Manchester created a need for a commercial structure; for a cotton exchange and warehousing. The technology was used in woollen and worsted mills in the West Riding of Yorkshire and elsewhere.[NEWLINE][TAB]With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton and Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanised textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure - the canals and, after 1831, the railways - facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The fishing industry includes any industry or activity concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing or selling fish or fish products. It is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization as including recreational, subsistence and commercial fishing, and the harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors. The commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other seafood products for human consumption or as input factors in other industrial processes. Directly or indirectly, the livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries depends on fisheries and aquaculture. [NEWLINE][TAB]Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit, mostly from wild fisheries. It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the earth, but those who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions. Large-scale commercial fishing is also known as industrial fishing. This profession has gained in popularity with the development of shows such as Deadliest Catch, Swords, and Wicked Tuna. The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well. The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit. Commercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals, ranging from tuna, cod, carp, and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid, and crab, in various fisheries for these species. [PARAGRAPH:1]There are large and important fisheries worldwide for various species of fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and echinoderms. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are fished in smaller numbers.[NEWLINE][TAB]The industry, in 2006, also managed to generate over 185 billion dollars in sales and also provide over two million jobs in the United States, according to an economic report released by NOAA's Fisheries Service. Commercial fishing may offer an abundance of jobs, but the pay varies from boat to boat, season to season.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Before about 1860 steel was an expensive product, made in small quantities and used mostly for swords, tools and cutlery; all large metal structures were made of wrought or cast iron. Steelmaking was centered in Sheffield, Britain, which supplied the European and the American markets. The introduction of cheap steel was due to the Bessemer and the open hearth processes, two technological advances made in England. In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron is converted to steel by blowing air through it after it was removed from the furnace. The air blast burned the carbon and silicon out of the pig iron, releasing heat and causing the temperature of the molten metal to rise. Henry Bessemer demonstrated the process in 1856 and had a successful operation going by 1864. By 1870 Bessemer steel was widely used for ship plate. By the 1850s, the speed, weight, and quantity of railway traffic was limited by the strength of the wrought iron rails in use. The solution was to turn to steel rails, which the Bessemer process made competitive in price. Experience quickly proved steel had much greater strength and durability and could handle the increasingly heavy and faster engines and cars. After 1890 the Bessemer process was gradually supplanted by open-hearth steelmaking and by the middle of the 20th century was no longer in use. The open-hearth process originated in the 1860s in Germany and France. The usual open-hearth process used pig iron, ore, and scrap, and became known as the Siemens-Martin process. Its process allowed closer control over the composition of the steel; also, a substantial quantity of scrap could be included in the charge. The crucible process remained important for making high-quality alloy steel into the 20th century. By 1900 the electric arc furnace was adapted to steelmaking and by the 1920s, the falling cost of electricity allowed it to largely supplant the crucible process for specialty steels.</English>

Its importance to the world economy evolved slowly, with whale oil used for lighting in the 19th century and wood and coal used for heating and cooking well into the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution generated an increasing need for energy which was met mainly by coal, and with other sources including whale oil. However, when it was discovered that kerosene could be extracted from crude oil and used as a lighting and heating fuel, petroleum was in great demand, and by the early twentieth century had become the most valuable commodity traded on world markets.[PARAGRAPH:1]The petroleum industry includes the global processes of exploration, extraction, refining, transporting (often by oil tankers and pipelines), and marketing petroleum products. The largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline (petrol). Petroleum (oil) is also the raw material for many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, and plastics. The industry is usually divided into three major components: upstream, midstream and downstream. Midstream operations are usually included in the downstream category. Petroleum is vital to many industries, and is of importance to the maintenance of industrial civilization in its current configuration, and thus is a critical concern for many nations. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the world's energy consumption, ranging from a low of 32% for Europe and Asia, to a high of 53% for the Middle East.</English>

While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away. Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through. The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam-Webster in 1951. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no shelter or seating, or fast food restaurants (also known as quick service restaurants). Franchise operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), fast foods are quick and cheap alternatives to home-cooked meals. They are also high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and calories. Eating too much fast food has been linked to, among other things, obesity and high cholesterol.[NEWLINE][TAB]The traditional family dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway, or eating "on the run". As a result, the time invested on food preparation is getting lower and lower, with an average couple in the United States spending 47 minutes and 19 minutes per day, carrying out food preparation.</English>

It consists of commercial industry involved in research and development, engineering, production, and the servicing of military material, equipment, and facilities. Arms-producing companies, also referred to as defense contractors or as the military industry, produce arms mainly for the armed forces of states. Departments of government also operate in the arms industry, buying and selling weapons, munitions and other military items. Products include guns, ammunition, missiles, military aircraft, military vehicles, ships, electronic systems, and more. The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces. Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens. Illegal trade in small arms occurs in many countries and regions affected by political instability. The Small Arms Survey estimates that 875 million small arms circulate worldwide, produced by more than 1,000 companies from nearly 100 countries. Contracts to supply a given country's military are awarded by governments, making arms contracts of substantial political importance. The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development of what U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower described as a military-industrial complex, where the armed forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked, similarly to the European defence procurement. Various corporations, some publicly held, others private, bid for these contracts, which are often worth many billions of dollars. Sometimes, as with the contract for the international Joint Strike Fighter, a competitive tendering process takes place, with the decision made on the merits of the designs submitted by the companies involved.

		<English>[TAB]The use of blitzkrieg during the German invasion of France first demonstrated the power of speed and maneuverability over static artillery positions and trench defenses. Through the use of tanks, mechanized infantry, and close air support, the Germans were able to quickly break through linear defenses and capture the rear. The emphasis on maneuvering and speed to bypass enemy engagement remains a common strategy throughout the world, and collapsing an enemy's defenses by striking at deeper targets is-in a somewhat different way-a major strategy in fourth generation warfare. The contributions of the third generation were based on the concept of overcoming technological disadvantage through the use of clever strategy. As linear fighting came to an end, new ways of moving faster began to appear. The emphasis on cavalry moved from heavy armor to greater speed, the development of the helicopter allowed insertions in hostile territory, and advanced missile technology allowed forces to bypass enemy defenses and strike at targets from great distances. The speed inherent in these methods necessitated a greater degree of independence allowed to the units on the front lines. Greater trust needed to be placed in junior officers commanding sub-units by higher-ranking officers-a belief that they could adequately achieve their objectives without micromanagement from higher ranking commanders in command headquarters. Smaller units were allowed greater decision flexibility to deal with changing situations on the ground, rather than have decisions made for them by commanders who were distant from the front. This began to break down the regimented culture of order that was so important in previous theoretical eras of military command and control.</English>

In other words, a mercenary is a person who fights for personal gains of money or other recompense instead of fighting for the ideological interests of a country, whether they be for or against the existing government. In the last century, and as reflected in the Geneva Convention, mercenaries have increasingly come to be seen as less entitled to protections by rules of war than non-mercenaries. However, whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree, as financial and national interests may overlap.[PARAGRAPH:1]An early recorded use of foreign auxiliaries dates back to Ancient Egypt, the thirteenth century BC, when Pharaoh Ramesses II used 11,000 mercenaries during his battles. A long established foreign corps in the Egyptian forces were the Medjay - a generic term given to tribal scouts and light infantry recruited from Nubia serving from the late period of the Old Kingdom through that of the New Kingdom. Other warriors recruited from outside the borders of Egypt included Libyan, Syrian and Canaanite contingents under the New Kingdom and Sherdens from Sardinia who appear in their distinctive horned helmets on wall paintings as body guards for Ramesses II. Celtic mercenaries were greatly employed in the Greek world (leading to the sack of Delphi and the Celtic settlement of Galatia). The Greek rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt, too, used Celtic mercenaries. Carthage was unique for relying primarily on mercenaries to fight its wars.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A militia generally is an army or other fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, beginning as early as the late 20th century, some militias (particularly officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government) act as professional forces, while still being "part-time" or "on-call" organizations. For instance, the members of some U.S. Army National Guard units are considered professional soldiers, as they are trained to maintain the same standards as their "full-time" (active duty) counterparts.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A pantheon (literally "(a temple) of all gods") is the particular set of all gods of any polytheistic religion, mythology, or tradition:[PARAGRAPH:1]A pantheon is an overview of a given culture's gods and goddesses and reflects not only the society's values but also its sense of itself. A pantheon directed by a thunderboltwielding autocrat might suggest a patriarchy and the valuing of warrior skills. A pantheon headed by a great-mother goddess could suggest a village-based agricultural society. To confront the pantheon of the Egyptians is to confront a worldview marked by a sense of death and resurrection and the agricultural importance of the cycles of nature. The Greek pantheon is a metaphor for a pragmatic view of life that values art, beauty, and the power of the individual, and that is somewhat skeptical about human nature.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for all citizens, sometimes referred to as public aid. In most developed countries welfare is largely provided by the government, and to a lesser extent, charities, informal social groups, religious groups, and inter-governmental organizations. The welfare state expands on this concept to include services such as universal healthcare and unemployment insurance. Welfare can take a variety of forms, such as monetary payments, subsidies and vouchers, or housing assistance. Welfare systems differ from country to country, but welfare is commonly provided to individuals who are unemployed, those with illness or disability, the elderly, those with dependent children, and veterans. A person's eligibility for welfare may also be constrained by means testing or other conditions. Welfare is provided by governments or their agencies, by private organizations, or a combination of both. Funding for welfare usually comes from general government revenue, but when dealing with charities or NGOs, donations may be used. Some countries run conditional cash transfer welfare programs where payment is conditional on behaviour of the recipients.</English>

In modern times, the definition of a republic is commonly limited to a government which excludes a monarch. Republics became more common in the Western world starting in the late 18th century, eventually displacing absolute monarchy as the most common form of government in Europe. In modern republics the executive is legitimized both by a constitution and by popular suffrage.[PARAGRAPH:1]In liberal democracies presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council. Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States. In that country the president is officially elected by an electoral college, chosen by the States, all of which do so by direct election of the electors. The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the concept of republic as one with a system of indirect election. In the opinion of some, direct election confers legitimacy upon the president and gives the office much of its political power. However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the signing of the Constitution by nine states. The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the spirit of the Great Compromise, whose actual result was manifest in the clause that provides voters in smaller states with slightly more representation in presidential selection than those in large states.</English>

It originated as an outgrowth of, and a departure from, Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities.[PARAGRAPH:1]Not so much a philosophy or a theology as a method of learning, scholasticism places a strong emphasis on dialectical reasoning to extend knowledge by inference, and to resolve contradictions. Scholastic thought is also known for rigorous conceptual analysis and the careful drawing of distinctions. In the classroom and in writing, it often takes the form of explicit disputation: a topic drawn from the tradition is broached in the form of a question, opponents' responses are given, a counterproposal is argued and opponent's arguments rebutted. Because of its emphasis on rigorous dialectical method, scholasticism was eventually applied to many other fields of study.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries. One manifestation of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people. Another manifestation of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions, especially political ones, should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs and/or practices.[PARAGRAPH:1]The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely. In European laicism, it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward modernization, and away from traditional religious values (also known as secularization). This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official state church or other state support of religion. In the United States, some argue that state secularism has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent. Within countries as well, differing political movements support secularism for varying reasons.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its tenants, the Palace lies on the Middlesex bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. Its name, which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey, may refer to either of two structures: the Old Palace, a medieval building complex that was destroyed by fire in 1834, and its replacement New Palace that stands today. For ceremonial purposes, the palace retains its original style and status as a royal residence.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first royal palace was built on the site in the eleventh century, and Westminster was the primary London residence of the Kings of England until a fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of Parliament, which had been meeting there since the thirteenth century, and the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice, based in and around Westminster Hall. In 1834, an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only structures of significance to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft and the Jewel Tower.[PARAGRAPH:1]The subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace was won by architect Charles Barry and his design for a building in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The remains of the Old Palace (with the exception of the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated in its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards. Part of the New Palace's area of 3.24 hectares (8 acres) was reclaimed from the Thames, which is the setting of its principal façade, the 266-metre (873 ft) river front. Barry was assisted by Augustus W. N. Pugin, a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, who provided designs for the decoration and furnishings of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for thirty years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the twentieth century. Major conservation work has been carried out since, due to the effects of London's air pollution, and extensive repairs took place after the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; "Westminster" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament, and the Westminster system of government has taken its name after it. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, which is often referred to by the name of its main bell, "Big Ben", is an iconic landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. The Palace of Westminster has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.</English>

It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210-209 BC and whose purpose was to help guard his empire in his afterlife.[NEWLINE][TAB]The figures, dating from 3rd century BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor.[NEWLINE][TAB]The figures vary in height, according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots, horses, officials, acrobats, strongmen and musicians. Current estimates are that in the three pits containing the Terracotta Army there were over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Terracotta Army was discovered in the spring of 1974 to the east of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province by a group of farmers when they were digging a water well 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Mount Li (Lishan), a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses. For centuries, there were reports of pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis - roofing tiles, bricks, and chunks of masonry - having been occasionally dug up in the area. This most recent discovery prompted archaeologists to investigate, and they unearthed the largest pottery figurine group ever found in China. In 195 B.C., Liu Bang - the first emperor of the dynasty that followed the Qin - had ordered that 'twenty households' should move to the site of the mausoleum of the First Emperor of Qin (Shi Huangdi, "Shi Huangdi" means the first emperor) to watch over the tomb. To this day, twenty villages sit in the immediate vicinity of the mausoleum, one of them the hamlet where those who made the discovery lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to the warriors, an entire man-made necropolis for the emperor has also been found. Qin Shi Huangdi's necropolis complex was constructed as a microcosm of his imperial palace or compound. It consists of several offices, halls, stables and other structures placed around the tomb mound which is surrounded by two solidly built rammed earth walls with gateway entrances. Up to 5 meters (16 feet) of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the centuries following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the digs at Mount Li, archaeologists found several graves dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments which were then discarded as worthless back into the back-filled soil.[NEWLINE][TAB]According to historian Sima Qian (145-90 BC), work on this mausoleum began in 246 BC soon after Emperor Qin ascended the throne (then aged 13), and the full construction later involved 700,000 workers. Geographer Li Daoyuan, six centuries after the death of the First Emperor, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology: "... famed for its jade mines, its northen side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, envious of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there". Sima Qian, in his most famous work, Shiji, completed a century after the mausoleum completion, wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artefacts and wonderful objects. According to this account, there were 100 rivers simulated with flowing mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models" or "imitations," those words however weren't used in the original text.[PARAGRAPH:2]Recent scientific work at the site has found high levels of mercury in the soil of the tomb mound, giving some credence to Sima Qian 's account of the emperor's tomb. The tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li as an earthen pyramid, and the tomb of Shi Huangdi appears to be a hermetically sealed space that is as big as a football pitch and located underneath the pyramid. The tomb remains unopened, one possible reason may be concerns about the preservation of valuable artifacts once the tomb is opened. For example, the painted surface of the terracotta army began to flake and fade once they have been excavated. Later historical accounts suggested that the tomb had been looted by Xiang Yu, a contender for the throne, five years after the death of the emperor, however there are indications that the tomb may not have been plundered.[NEWLINE][TAB]Only a portion of the site is presently excavated, and photos and video recordings are prohibited in some viewing areas. Only a few foreign dignitaries, such as Queen Elizabeth II, have been permitted to walk through the pits to observe the army at close quarters.</English>

		<English>Johannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn-a man who had previously instructed in gem-cutting-and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill. However, it was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds. [PARAGRAPH:1]Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions, a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies. A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials. The new era in print ushered in by the Internet is a distant mirror to Gutenberg's work which similarly revolutionized the printing process.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Longships were a type of ship invented and used by the Norsemen for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. A similar design was sailed by the Sumerians many centuries before.[citation needed] The longship's design evolved over many centuries, beginning in the Stone Age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up until the 6th century with clinker built ships like Nydam and Kvalsund. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth sails (woven wool) and had numerous details and carvings on the hull.[PARAGRAPH:1]The longships were characterized as a graceful, long, narrow and light wooden boat, with a shallow-draft hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted random beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages or used bottoms up for shelter in camps. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern letting the ship to reverse direction quickly without a turn around; this trait proved particularly useful at northern latitudes, where icebergs and sea ice posed hazards to navigation. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions had a rectangular sail on a single mast, which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship, but lay in the range of 5-10 knots (9.3-18.5 km/h) and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions, was around 15 knots (28 km/h).[PARAGRAPH:1]Longships were the epitome of naval power in their time and were highly valued possessions. They were often communally owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by kings in times of conflict, in order to quickly assemble a large and powerful naval force. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were mostly used for troop transports, not warships. In the tenth century, longships would sometimes be tied together in offshore battles to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. During the 9th century peak of the Viking expansion, large fleets set out to attack the degrading Frankish empire by attacking up navigable rivers such as the Seine. Rouen was sacked in 841, the year after the death of Louis the Pious, a son of Charlemagne. Quentovic, near modern Etables, was attacked in 842 and 600 Danish ships attacked Hamburg in 845. In the same year, 129 ships returned to attack up the Seine. They were called "dragonships" by enemies such as the English because they had a dragon-shaped bow. The Norse had a strong sense of naval architecture, and during the early medieval period they were advanced for their time.</English>

With the proliferation and consolidation of the concept of chivalry, much focus was given to the knight as the central figure in warfare, nevertheless it's a false assumption that heavy infantry became obsolete during the period, as evidenced by the Scottish and Irish wars against the English, by the Flemish and Italian citizen-militias, and by the Byzantine methods of war (which was based on the Roman legionary and Greek hoplite models, see Skoutatoi). While the trend in Eastern Europe beyond the Dnieper among the nomadic peoples like the Pechenegs and Kypchaks was essentially based on horse archers, the peoples of modern Ukraine and western Russia favored a mix of heavy infantry and Asian-style cavalry warfare. Peoples like the Hungarians, Poles and Bulgarians gradually abandoned their native ways of warfare in favor of imitating the Western European knights or Byzantine heavy cavalry.[PARAGRAPH:1]All of this would change with the introduction of gunpowder in Europe in the late 14th century, and the highly successful and innovating pikemen tactics pioneered by the Swiss mercenaries led to the increased preference for mostly infantry professional armies. Gunpowder and the skillful use of the pike would give birth to the Middle Age heavy infantry and place it on an equal footing with cavalry. Heavy infantry would usually be armored like a knight with mail armor and an iron helmet, and would carry a pike. Other heavy infantry would probably be armed with little armor and a gunpowder weapon, which were capable of penetrating armor. The introduction of such weapons as gunpowder and the pike resulted in the reintroduction of the infantry into armies and shifted dominance of the battlefield away from the knights.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Stonemasonry is one of the earliest trades in civilization's history. During the time of the Neolithic Revolution and domestication of animals, people learned how to use fire to create quicklime, plasters, and mortars. They used these to fashion homes for themselves with mud, straw, or stone, and masonry was born. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Ancients heavily relied on the stonemason to build the most impressive and long lasting monuments to their civilizations. The Egyptians built their pyramids, the civilizations of Central America had their step pyramids, the Persians their palaces, the Greeks their temples, and the Romans their public works and wonders. Among the famous ancient stonemasons is Sophroniscus, the father of Socrates, who was a stone-cutter. [PARAGRAPH:1]Castle building was an entire industry for the medieval stonemasons. When the Western Roman Empire fell, building in dressed stone decreased in much of Western Europe, and there was a resulting increase in timber-based construction. Stone work experienced a resurgence in the 9th and 10th centuries in Europe, and by the 12th century religious fervour resulted in the construction of thousands of impressive churches and cathedrals in stone across Western Europe.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_TANNERY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]In ancient history, tanning was considered a noxious or "odoriferous trade" and relegated to the outskirts of town, amongst the poor. Indeed, tanning by ancient methods is so foul smelling, tanneries are still isolated from those towns today where the old methods are used. Ancient civilizations used leather for waterskins, bags, harnesses and tack, boats, armour, quivers, scabbards, boots, and sandals. Tanning was being carried out by the South Asian inhabitants of Mehrgarh between 7000 and 3300 BC. Around 2500 BC, the Sumerians began using leather, affixed by copper studs, on chariot wheels.[PARAGRAPH:1]Skins typically arrived at the tannery dried stiff and dirty with soil and gore. First, the ancient tanners would soak the skins in water to clean and soften them. Then they would pound and scour the skin to remove any remaining flesh and fat. Next, the tanner needed to remove the hair from the skin. This was done by either soaking the skin in urine[citation needed], painting it with an alkaline lime mixture, or simply allowing the skin to putrefy for several months then dipping it in a salt solution. After the hairs were loosened, the tanners scraped them off with a knife.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once the hair was removed, the tanners would "bate" (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains. Bating was a fermentative process which relied on enzymes produced by bacteria found in the dung. Among the kinds of dung commonly used were those of dogs or pigeons. Sometimes, the dung was mixed with water in a large vat, and the prepared skins were kneaded in the dung water until they became supple from bacterial enzyme action, but not too soft. The ancient tanner might use his bare feet to knead the skins in the dung water, and the kneading could last two or three hours.[PARAGRAPH:1]This combination of urine, animal feces, and decaying flesh made ancient tanneries malodorous. Children employed as dung gatherers were a common sight in ancient cities. Also common were "piss-pots" located on street corners, where human urine could be collected for use in tanneries or by washerwomen. In some variations of the process, cedar oil, alum, or tannin were applied to the skin as a tanning agent. As the skin was stretched, it would lose moisture and absorb the agent.[PARAGRAPH:1]Leftover leather would be turned into glue. Tanners would place scraps of hides in a vat of water and let them deteriorate for months. The mixture would then be placed over a fire to boil off the water to produce glue.</English>

As such it represents a form of levy (taxation). Unlike other forms of levy, such as a tithe, a corvée does not require the population to have land, crops or cash. It was thus favored in historical economies in which barter was more common than cash transactions and/or circulating money is in short supply. The obligation for tenant farmers to perform corvée work for landlords on private landed estates has been widespread throughout history. The term is most typically used in reference to medieval and early modern Europe, where work was often expected by a feudal landowner (of their vassals), or by a monarch of their subjects.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Agrarianism has two common meanings. The first meaning refers to a social philosophy or political philosophy which values rural society as superior to urban society, the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values. It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life, with its banks and factories.[PARAGRAPH:1]Secondly, the term "agrarianism" means political proposals for land redistribution, specifically the distribution of land from the rich to the poor or landless. This terminology is common in many countries, and originated from the "Lex Sempronia Agraria" or "agrarian laws" of Rome in 133 BC, imposed by Tiberius Gracchus, that seized public land (ager publicus) used by the rich and distributed it to the poor. This definition of agrarianism is commonly known as "agrarian reform." In 18th- and 19th-century England and Ireland, the word identified any land reform movement that sought to redistribute farm lands more equally, especially to landless Irish families.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of some indigenous tribal peoples, especially prior to the development of organized religion. Animism encompasses the beliefs that there is no separation between the spiritual and physical (or material) world, and that souls or spirits exist, not only in humans, but also in some other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers, or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind, and shadows. Animism thus rejects Cartesian dualism. Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, true names, or metaphors in mythology. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author Daniel Quinn, sculptor Lawson Oyekan, and many contemporary Pagans).</English>

Absolute monarchy and dictatorship are the main historical forms of autocracy. In very early times, the term "autocrat" was written in coins as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of "lack of conflicts of interests".[PARAGRAPH:1]Both totalitarianism and military dictatorship are often identified with, but need not be, an autocracy. Totalitarianism is a system where the state strives to control every aspect of life and civil society.

Historically, this included famous cities like Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissance-but today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. However, a great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. In particular, Singapore has been referred to by The Economist as the "world's only fully-functioning city-state".[PARAGRAPH:1]A number of other states share similar characteristics, and therefore are sometimes also cited as modern city-states. These include Malta, Bahrain, and San Marino which are microstates with high population densities; as well as Qatar, Brunei, and Kuwait, each with an urban center comprising a significant proportion of the population.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIVIC_CONSCRIPTION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1-8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.[PARAGRAPH:1]Conscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including conscientious objection to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing alternative service outside combat-operations roles or even outside the military, such as Zivildienst (civil service) in Austria and Switzerland. Most post-Soviet countries conscript soldiers not only for Armed Forces but also for paramilitary organizations which are dedicated to police-like domestic only service (Internal Troops) or non-combat rescue duties (Civil Defence Troops) - none of which is considered alternative to the military conscription. As of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with volunteers enlisted to meet the demand for troops. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during wartime or times of crisis.</English>

The CIA's headquarters is in Langley, Virginia, a few miles west of Washington, D.C. Its employees operate from U.S. embassies and many other locations around the world. The only independent U.S. intelligence agency, it reports to the Director of National Intelligence. The CIA has three traditional principal activities, which are gathering information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals; analyzing that information, along with intelligence gathered by other U.S. intelligence agencies, in order to provide national security intelligence assessment to senior United States policymakers; and, upon the request of the President of the United States, carrying out or overseeing covert activities and some tactical operations by its own employees, by members of the U.S. military, or by other partners. It can, for example, exert foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Division. In 2013, the Washington Post reported that the CIA's share of the National Intelligence Program (NIP), a non-military component of the overall U.S. Intelligence Community Budget, has increased to 28% in 2013, exceeding the NIP funding received by military agencies the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA has increasingly taken on offensive roles, including covert paramilitary operations. One of its largest divisions, the Information Operations Center (IOC), has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations. Several CIA activities have attracted criticism.

		<English>[TAB]A planned economy is an economic system in which inputs are based on direct allocation. Economic planning may be carried out in a decentralized, distributed or centralized manner depending on the specific organization of economic institutions. An economy based on economic planning (either through the state, an association of worker cooperatives or another economic entity that has jurisdiction over the means of production) appropriates its resources as needed, so that allocation comes in the form of internal transfers involving the purchasing of assets by one government agency or firm by another. In a traditional model of planning, decision-making would be carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level. Planned economies are held in contrast to unplanned economies, such as the market economy and proposed self-managed economy, where production, distribution, pricing, and investment decisions are made by autonomous firms based upon their individual interests rather than upon a macroeconomic plan. Less extensive forms of planned economies include those that use indicative planning as components of a market-based or mixed economy, in which the state employs "influence, subsidies, grants, and taxes, but does not compel." This latter is sometimes referred to as a "planned market economy". In some instances, the term planned economy has been used to refer to national economic development plans and state-directed investment in market economies.</English>

The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a "house"; this may be styled "royal", "princely", "comital", etc. depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. Until the 19th century, it was taken for granted that a legitimate function of a monarch was to aggrandize his dynasty: that is, to increase the territory, wealth, and power of his family members. The longest-surviving dynasty in the world is the Imperial House of Japan, the Yamato dynasty, whose reign is traditionally dated to 660 BC.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as under the Frankish Salic law. Succession through a daughter when permitted was considered to establish a new dynasty in her husband's ruling house. However, some states in Africa (Balobedu), determined descent matrilineally, while rulers have at other times adopted the name of their mother's dynasty when coming into her inheritance: examples include the Dutch House of Orange, the Georgian Bagrationi, and Habsburg-Lorraine. The word "dynasty" is sometimes used informally for people who are not rulers but, for example, members of a family with influence and power in other areas, such as a series of successive owners of a major company. It is also extended to unrelated people such as major poets of the same school or various rosters of a single sports team.</English>

Ellens says, "When Christianity came to power in the empire of Constantine, it proceeded almost to viciously repress all non-Christians and all Christians who did not line up with official Orthodox ideology, policy, and practice". An example of Christians who didn't line up with Orthodox ideology is the Donatists, who "refused to accept repentant clergy who had formerly given way to apostasy when persecuted".

Es wurde in den Jahren von 1788 bis 1791 auf Anweisung des preußischen Königs Friedrich Wilhelm II. von Carl Gotthard Langhans errichtet und ist das bekannteste Wahrzeichen der Stadt. Zugleich ist das Tor ein nationales Symbol, mit dem viele wichtige Ereignisse der Geschichte Berlins, Deutschlands, Europas und der Welt des 20. Jahrhunderts verbunden sind. Der Bau ist dem frühklassizistischen Stil zuzuordnen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit dem Bau der Zollmauer der Stadt Berlin wurde 1734 ein Vorgängerbau des heutigen Brandenburger Tores als Stadttor an der Straße nach Brandenburg an der Havel errichtet. Die Toranlage bestand aus Pylonen und beigeordneten Wachhäusern. Im Zuge des Ausbaus der Mauer und ihrer Tore ließ Friedrich Wilhelm II. ab 1788 das Brandenburger Tor neu gestalten, das dem Andenken an den Krieg des kurz zuvor verstorbenen Friedrich II. diente, von dessen Verdiensten auch etwas Glanz auf den Neffen und Nachfolger fallen sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Architekt wurde Carl Gotthard Langhans beauftragt. Er orientierte sich an dem "Stadttor von Athen", das er aus Stichen von Leroy, Stuart und Revett kannte, die aber die Propyläen der Athener Akropolis abgebildet hatten. Das Eingangstor zur Akropolis war im dorischen Stil des Parthenon gehalten, um eine optische Einheit zu bilden. Das Tor hatte eine breite Mittelöffnung und zwei schmale Seiteneingänge für Fußgänger. Im rechten Winkel dazu standen zwei Seitenflügel. Nach Langhans Planung sollten entsprechend beim Berliner Tor durch den breiten Mittelgang die königlichen Kutschen, daneben die sonstigen Gespanne fahren und außen die Fußgänger gehen. In den Seitenflügeln sollten die Wache und die Akziseeinnehmer untergebracht werden. 1788 wurde das alte Tor abgerissen, eine große Baugrube ausgehoben und fundamentiert. 1789 wurde der Neubau begonnen. Die Baukosten lagen bei 111.000 Talern. Am 6. August 1791 wurde das noch nicht ganz fertige Tor geöffnet.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die 1793 von Johann Gottfried Schadow gefertigte Quadriga auf dem Brandenburger Tor stellte ursprünglich nach der wohl überwiegend vertretenen Auffassung eine geflügelte Friedensbringerin dar. Das Brandenburger Tor erhielt den Namen Friedenstor, diesen Namen zeigte auch eine Inschrift aus Bronzelettern am Tor. Diese Sinngebung interpretiert auch der bildliche Schmuck. Die Entwürfe für die Reliefs wurden vorwiegend von dem Maler und Akademiedirektor Christian Bernhard Rode angefertigt. Schadow hat die Entwürfe überarbeitet und die Steinmetze bei der Ausführung beaufsichtigt. Die Göttin in der Quadriga wird durch das Relief auf der Attika der Stadtseite als Friedensbringerin erklärt. Das Attikarelief steht unter dem Thema "Der Zug der Friedensgöttin". Im Zentrum des Reliefs über dem Mittelgang stehen Sinnbilder auf Frieden und Freundschaft. Die Friedensgöttin Eirene steht auf der äußersten Kante eines Triumphwagens. Mit der Rechten stützt sie sich auf den mit einer Lorbeergirlande geschmückten Rand des Wagens. In der einen Hand hält sie einen Palmenzweig, in der anderen einen Lorbeerkranz. Ihr Wagen wird von vier Eroten gezogen. Weiter rechts auf dem Attikarelief kann man Nike mit Flügeln und Tropaion erkennen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Direkt über diesem Relief steht die Quadriga Schadows. Deren göttliche Wagenlenkerin ist Nike und Eirene in einer Person. Nach einer abweichenden Auffassung soll es sich von Anfang an um eine "Siegesgöttin" gehandelt haben, unter anderem weil davon bereits im Vertrag zur Anfertigung der Figurengruppe vom 22. Juli 1789 die Rede gewesen sei. Schadow hatte ursprünglich für die Wagenlenkerin keine Trophäe entworfen. Ihm schwebte mehr die griechische Eirene als Friedensgöttin vor, als die römische Siegesgöttin Viktoria. 1793 verlangte dann aber ein Akademiebeschluss eine Kopie der Siegestrophäe der Nike rechts auf dem Attikarelief auch für die Wagenlenkerin der Quadriga. Bei der Bevölkerung fand sie keinen Zuspruch. Aufgrund heftiger Kritik besserte Schadow noch ein weiteres Mal nach. Das Tropaion wurde nun durch eine Lanze mit einem Lorbeerkranz und einem römischen Adler ersetzt. Außerdem erhielt die knapp bekleidete Wagenlenkerin nun ein bis auf den Boden reichendes Gewand.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Lubyanka is the popular name for the headquarters of the KGB and affiliated prison on Lubyanka Square in Moscow. It is a large building with a facade of yellow brick, designed by Alexander V. Ivanov in 1897 and augmented by Aleksey Shchusev in 1940-1947.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The Lubyanka was originally built in 1898 as the Neo-Baroque headquarters of the All-Russia Insurance Company, noted for its beautiful parquet floors and pale green walls. Belying its massiveness, the edifice avoids an impression of heroic scale: isolated Palladian and Baroque details, such as the minute pediments over the corner bays and the central loggia, are lost in an endlessly-repeating classicizing palace facade, where three bands of cornices emphasize the horizontal lines. A clock is centered in the uppermost band of the facade.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Following the Bolshevik Revolution, the structure was seized by the government for the headquarters of the secret police, then called the Cheka. In Soviet Russian jokes it was referred to as the tallest building in Moscow, since Siberia could be seen from its basement. Another joke referred to the building as "Adult's World" as compared to "Children's World," the name of the popular toy store across the street.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]During the Great Purge, the offices became increasingly cramped due to staff numbers. In 1940, the most famous Soviet architect, Shchusev, was commissioned to double its size by adding another storey and engulfing backstreet buildings. Shchusev's design accentuated Neo-Renaissance detailing, but only the left part of the facade was reconstructed under his direction in the 1940s, due to the war and other hindrances. This asymmetric facade survived intact until 1983, when the symmetry was restored at the urging of Yuri Andropov in accordance with Shchusev's plans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Although the Soviet secret police changed its name many times, its headquarters remained in this building. Secret police chiefs from Lavrenty Beria to Yuri Andropov used the same office on the third floor, which looked down on the statue of Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. A prison at the ground floor of the building figures prominently in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's classic study of the Soviet police state, The Gulag Archipelago. Famous inmates held, tortured and interrogated there include Sidney Reilly, Raoul Wallenberg, János Esterházy and Father Walter Ciszek, S.J.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]After the dissolution of the KGB, the Lubyanka became the headquarters of the Border Guard Service of Russia, and houses the Lubyanka prison and one directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). In addition a museum of the KGB was opened to the public. On November 11, 1999 a fire broke out in the Lubyanka. Four FSB agents were injured, but damage was relatively mild. The fire was later traced to faulty wiring.</English>

It was constructed in about 575 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dedicated to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, the gate was constructed of blue glazed tiles with alternating rows of bas-relief sirrush (dragons) and aurochs.[PARAGRAPH:2]The roof and doors of the gate were of cedar, according to the dedication plaque. Through the gate ran the Processional Way, which was lined with walls covered in lions on glazed bricks (about 120 of them).[PARAGRAPH:2]Statues of the deities were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way each year during the New Year's celebration.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally the gate, being part of the Walls of Babylon, was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the world until, in the 6th century AD, it was replaced by the Lighthouse of Alexandria.[PARAGRAPH:2]A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way was built at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin out of material excavated by Robert Koldewey and finished in the 1930s. It includes the inscription plaque. It stands 47 feet high and 100 feet wide (14 meters by 30 meters). The excavation ran from 1902-1914, and, during that time, 45 feet of the foundation of the gate was uncovered.[PARAGRAPH:2]The gate was in fact a double gate. The part that is shown in the Pergamon Museum today is only the smaller, frontal part, while the larger, back part was considered too large to fit into the constraints of the structure of the museum. It is in storage.[PARAGRAPH:2]Parts of the gate and lions from the Processional Way are in various other museums around the world. Only three museums acquired dragons, while lions went to several museums. The Istanbul Archaeology Museum has lions, dragons, and bulls. The Detroit Institute of Arts houses a dragon. The Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, has one dragon and one lion; the Louvre, the State Museum of Egyptian Art in Munich, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Oriental Institute in Chicago, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, each have lions.</English>

Starting at Beijing, it passes through Tianjin and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the city of Hangzhou. The oldest parts of the canal date back to the 5th century BC, although the various sections were finally combined during the Sui Dynasty (581-618 CE).[NEWLINE][TAB]The total length of the Grand Canal is 1,776 km (1,103 miles). Its greatest height is reached in the mountains of Shandong, at a summit of 42 m (138 ft). Ships in Chinese canals did not have trouble reaching higher elevations after the pound lock was invented in the 10th century, during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), by the government official and engineer Qiao Weiyo. The canal's size and grandeur won it the admiration of many throughout history, including the Japanese monk Ennin (794-864), the Persian historian Rashid al-Din (1247-1318), the Korean official Choe Bu (1454-1504) and the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci (1552-1610).[NEWLINE][TAB]Historically, periodic flooding of the adjacent Yellow River threatened the safety and functioning of the canal. During wartime the high dikes of the Yellow River were sometimes deliberately broken in order to flood advancing enemy troops. This caused disaster and prolonged economic hardships. Despite temporary periods of desolation and disuse, the Grand Canal furthered an indigenous and growing economic market in China's urban centers through all the ages since the Sui period.</English>

The building, now a museum, is officially known as the Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat. It was built from 1555-61 on orders from Ivan the Terrible and commemorates the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan. A world-famous landmark, it was the city's tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600. The original building, known as Trinity Church and later Trinity Cathedral, contained eight side churches arranged around the ninth, central church of Intercession; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil). In the 16th and 17th centuries, the church, perceived as the earthly symbol of the Heavenly City, as happens to all churches in Byzantine Christianity, was popularly known as the "Jerusalem" and served as an allegory of the Jerusalem Temple in the annual Palm Sunday parade attended by the Patriarch of Moscow and the tsar.[NEWLINE][TAB]The building is shaped as a flame of a bonfire rising into the sky, a design that has no analogues in Russian architecture. Dmitry Shvidkovsky, in his book Russian Architecture and the West, states that "it is like no other Russian building. Nothing similar can be found in the entire millennium of Byzantine tradition from the fifth to fifteenth century ... a strangeness that astonishes by its unexpectedness, complexity and dazzling interleaving of the manifold details of its design." The cathedral foreshadowed the climax of Russian national architecture in the 17th century.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A chartered company is an association formed by investors or shareholders for the purpose of trade, exploration, and colonization. Companies enabled merchants to band together to undertake ventures requiring more capital than was available to any one merchant or family. From the sixteenth century onwards, groups of European investors formed companies to underwrite and profit from the exploration of Africa, India, Asia, the Caribbean and North America, usually under the patronage of one state, which issued the company's charter. But chartered companies go back into the medieval period. Authorizations of charters enabled even small states to greatly augment their influence by indirect rule, steering private resources into national pursuits of exploration and trade. As they grew wealthier, some companies developed extensive administrations for their ventures, and frequently conducted local affairs with little homeland oversight.[NEWLINE][TAB]Chartered companies were usually formed, incorporated and legitimised under a royal or, in republics, an equivalent government charter. This document set out the terms under which the company could trade; defined its boundaries of influence, and described its rights and responsibilities.</English>

On the Espionage Screen, these points may be assigned to leaders that the player has met. These points may be used to perform various Active and Passive Espionage Missions. Active Missions require the player to spend Espionage Points and have a spy in the territory of the opponent they wish to perform the mission against. Passive Missions will take effect as the player accrues more points against a specific opponent. Having more espionage points accumulated will increase the cost of your opponents' missions towards you and reduce the cost of your missions towards them.[PARAGRAPH:1]The [LINK=BUILDING_COURTHOUSE]Courthouse[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_JAIL]Jail[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_PALACE]Palace[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_CASTLE]Castle[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_NATIONAL_SECURITY]Security Bureau[\LINK] and [LINK=BUILDING_INTELLIGENCE_AGENCY]Intelligence Agency[\LINK] all increase the production of Espionage points. The Security Bureau Building increases the point cost of enemy missions in your cities.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage Screen[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Espionage Points may be assigned to specific opponents on the Espionage Screen. If you do not assign points to specific leaders, they will be evenly divided between all known civs. By increasing the "Weight" item next to each opponent's portrait, you can assign the portion you would like each opponent to receive. Increasing the weight next to an opponent's name to "1" will assign all Espionage Points to that opponent. Increasing one opponent's weight to "2" while keeping two other opponents' weight at "1" and another's at "0" will give the first opponent twice as many points as the second and third, while the fourth will receive none. You may assign Weights in any fractions you like, up to 99. In this way, you can finely tune the portion of Espionage Points you would like assigned to each of your opponents.[PARAGRAPH:1]Below "Weight" is a number that shows the cost modifier for your Espionage Missions against this opponent. This number is based on the total number of Espionage Points you have spent throughout the game against this opponent. If the number is below 100%% that means you have spent more on Espionage than your opponent, and your missions may be performed at a discount. If the number is greater than 100%%, it means your opponent has spent more on Espionage than you. This will increase the cost of your Espionage Missions directed towards that opponent. The bottom item on the list states exactly how many Espionage Points you earn per turn towards that opponent. You can also see the Espionage Points you have against all players and the points they have against you by hovering the mouse over their score in the main interface.[PARAGRAPH:1]On the right half of the espionage screen is the list of all the Espionage Missions and their costs. You may click on an opponent's portrait to see a list of all their visible cities and the cost of missions in the selected city. Costs vary according to a number of factors, including the size of the city, its distance from your civilization, and religions present. If the cost of a Mission is blank, this means that the Mission requires more information to determine the exact cost, meaning you must move a spy into enemy territory before the mission cost can be determined. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Spies[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Spies may be built by a Civilization that has researched [LINK=TECH_ALPHABET]The Alphabet[\LINK]. Spies differ greatly from most units. Completely invisible to enemy Civilizations, Spies can enter enemy territory to perform one Espionage Mission per turn. Active missions are tile sensitive, meaning you will have to sneak your Spy onto the enemy improvement or city you wish to affect. Performing a mission costs a certain number of Espionage Points and will cause an indicator to pop-up for your opponent over the location of the mission, informing him of the act (but not necessarily of your Spy). If the mission succeeds, the Spy may  survive to perform more Missions, or she may be caught and destroyed. If the mission fails, the Spy will be destroyed, but no Espionage Points will be consumed. The cost of these Espionage Missions decrease the longer a Spy remains stationary on a tile, but every turn a Spy remains in enemy territory, there is a chance that she will be caught and destroyed. The chances of being caught increase with your opponent's Espionage spending, with the presence of a Security Bureau and if your Spy has recently performed a mission against that tile. If the Spy is caught, there is also a chance that its owner will be revealed.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition to performing Espionage Missions, Spies also make excellent intelligence gatherers. They can use enemy roads and enter the cities of opponents with whom the player is at war, allowing the player access to otherwise unreachable information. The downside is that spies have a chance to get caught when they end their turn in unwelcome territory, even if they perform no active missions. Unwelcome territory is any territory belonging to a rival with whom you do not have an open borders agreement.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Missions[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]To perform an Espionage Mission, a player must move a Spy unit to the plot or city where they would like to perform the mission and select the Espionage Mission button.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Espionage Missions are:[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Sabotage Improvement[\BOLD] - Destroy an enemy improvement or route[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Sabotage Building[\BOLD] - Destroy a building within an enemy city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Steal Treasury[\BOLD] - Steal a portion of your opponent's treasury, between 10 and 100%%[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Spread Culture[\BOLD] - Increase your cultural influence in a city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Poison Water[\BOLD] - Temporarily increase the amount of unhealthiness within an enemy city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Foment Unhappiness[\BOLD] - Temporarily increase unhappiness within an enemy city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Support City Revolt[\BOLD] - Send a city into revolt for one turn.

		<English>[TAB]The Galleass is a large, fast, heavily armed three-masted Mediterranean galley with a forecastle and aftcastle from the 16th and 17th centuries. As converted for military use they were higher and larger than regular ("light") galleys. They had as many as thirty-two oars, each worked by up to 5 men. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as they could be so they could compete with regular galleys. The gun-deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, although pictures showing the opposite arrangement exist. Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys, and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, but coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, merely exposed an attacker to her gunfire. The galleass exemplified an intermediate type between the galley and the true man-of-war. Relatively few galleasses were built, one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed, but they featured at the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), their firepower helping to win victory for the Christian fleet, and some sufficiently seaworthy galleasses accompanied the Spanish Armada in 1588 (e.g. La Girona). In the Mediterranean, with its shallower waters, less dangerous weather and fickle winds, galleasses and galleys alike continued in use, particularly in Venice and Turkey, long after they became regarded as obsolete elsewhere. Later, "round ships" and galleasses were replaced by galleons and ships of the line which originated in northern Europe.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_MOTORIZED_INFANTRY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]In NATO and most other western countries, motorized infantry is infantry that is transported by trucks or other un-protected motor vehicles. It is distinguished from mechanized infantry, which is carried in armoured personnel carriers or infantry fighting vehicles, and from light infantry, which can typically operate autonomously from supporting elements and vehicles for relatively long periods and may be airborne.[NEWLINE][TAB]In Russia and the former Soviet Union, the term motostrelki is used to indicate mechanized infantry; and during the Korean War this usage prevailed in all Warsaw Pact countries.[NEWLINE][TAB]Motorizing infantry is the first stage towards the mechanization of an army. Civilian trucks are readily adaptable to military uses of transporting soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. This greatly increases the strategic mobility of infantry units, which would otherwise rely on marches or railroads. In practice, armies have found it advantageous to develop trucks to military specifications, such as all-wheel drive, in order to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain.[NEWLINE][TAB]Motorization provides no direct tactical advantage in small unit combat, because trucks and jeeps are vulnerable to artillery and small arms fire. However, in larger battles, motorized infantry have an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, as well as the ability to outmaneuver the enemy.[NEWLINE][TAB]The disadvantage of motorization is that the formation required many vehicles and supplies of fuel to be of advantage.[NEWLINE][TAB]The British created the Experimental Mechanized Force between the wars to test the capabilities of all-arms formations of mechanized units, this included motorized infantry ("Motor Battalions").[NEWLINE][TAB]The speed advantages of motorized infantry first became important in World War II in the German Blitzkrieg. While no more robust than regular infantry moving on foot, its increased speed became decisive in the Blitzkrieg strategy because it could follow the panzer forces and defend its flanks. Notwithstanding the obvious advantages of motorization, most countries only opted for partial motorization of their infantry because of the cost and logistical implications caused by the deployment of so many vehicles.[citation needed]. Even large armies were affected by these factors. The bulk of German and Soviet infantry remained on foot, while U.S. infantry divisions could, if needed, redirect the activities of enough trucks to motorize an infantry regiment. Likewise, infantry divisions of the UK and its Empire could motorize chosen subordinate units, but infantry advanced on foot in most cases.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Mechanized infantry are infantry equipped with armored personnel carriers (APCs) or infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) for transport and combat.[NEWLINE][TAB]Mechanized infantry is distinguished from motorized infantry in that its vehicles provide a degree of protection from hostile fire, as opposed to "soft-skinned" wheeled vehicles (trucks or jeeps) for motorized infantry. Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked, or are all-wheel drive vehicles (6×6 or 8×8), for mobility across rough ground. Some nations distinguish between mechanized and armoured infantry, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armoured.[NEWLINE][TAB]The support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with motorized transport, or are built directly into combat vehicles, in order to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. For units equipped with most types of APC or any type of IFV, fire support weapons, such as machine guns, autocannons, small-bore direct-fire howitzers, and even anti-tank guided missiles, are often mounted directly on the infantry's own transport vehicles.[NEWLINE][TAB]Compared with "light" truck-mobile infantry, mechanized infantry can maintain rapid tactical movement and (if mounted in IFVs) possess more integral firepower. They require more combat supplies (ammunition and especially fuel) and ordnance supplies (spare vehicle components), and a comparatively larger proportion of their manpower is required to crew and maintain the vehicles. For example, most APCs mount a section of seven or eight infantrymen, but have a crew of two. Most IFVs only carry six or seven infantry, but require a crew of three. To be effective in the field, mechanized units also require large numbers of mechanics with specialized maintenance and recovery vehicles and equipment.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of horses (then mostly small) to carry heavy armor. Cavalry techniques were an innovation of equestrian nomads of the Central Asian and Iranian steppe and pastoralist tribes such as the Persian Parthians and Sarmatians.[TAB]865 BC, the men had no spurs, saddles, saddle cloths, or stirrups. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the mounted archer were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows.[TAB]From earliest times cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and inertial mass over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.[TAB]The speed, mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the Ancient and Middle Ages; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in nomadic societies of Asia, notably the Mongol armies.</English>

He presided over a time of rapid change in the Empire of Japan, as the nation quickly changed from a feudal state to a capitalist and imperial world power, characterized by Japan industrial revolution.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the time of Meiji's birth in 1852, Japan was an isolated, pre-industrial, feudal country dominated by the Tokugawa shogunate and the daimyo, who ruled over the country's more than 250 decentralized domains. By the time of his death in 1912, Japan had undergone a political, social, and industrial revolution at home and emerged as one of the great powers on the world stage. The New York Times summed up this transformation at his funeral in 1912, with the words: "the contrast between that which preceded the funeral car and that which followed it was striking indeed. Before it went old Japan; after it came new Japan."[PARAGRAPH:2]In Japan, the reigning Emperor is always referred to as "The Emperor"; since the modern era, a deceased Emperor is referred to by a posthumous name, which is the name of the era coinciding with the Emperor's reign. Having ruled during the Meiji period, the Emperor is thus, posthumously known as "the Meiji Emperor" or simply "Emperor Meiji".

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_NAVIGATION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Sailors navigating in the Mediterranean made use of several techniques to determine their location, including staying in sight of land and understanding of the winds and their tendencies. Minoans of Crete are an example of an early Western civilization that used celestial navigation. Their palaces and mountaintop sanctuaries exhibit architectural features that align with the rising sun on the equinoxes, as well as the rising and setting of particular stars. The Minoans made sea voyages to the island of Thera and to Egypt. Both of these trips would have taken more than a day's sail for the Minoans and would have left them traveling by night across open water. Here the sailors would use the locations of particular stars, especially those of the constellation Ursa Major, to orient the ship in the correct direction.[TAB]Written records of navigation using stars, or celestial navigation, go back to Homer's Odyssey where Calypso tells Odysseus to keep the Bear (Ursa Major) on his left hand side and at the same time to observe the position of the Pleiades, the late-setting Boötes and the Orion as he sailed eastward from her island Ogygia traversing the Ocean. The Greek poet Aratus wrote in his Phainomena in the third century BC detailed positions of the constellations as written by Eudoxos. The positions described do not match the locations of the stars during Aratus' or Eudoxos' time for the Greek mainland, but some argue that they match the sky from Crete during the Bronze Age. This change in the position of the stars is due to the wobble of the Earth on its axis which affects primarily the pole stars. Around 1000 BC the constellation Draco would have been closer to the North Pole than Polaris. The pole stars were used to navigate because they did not disappear below the horizon and could be seen consistently throughout the night.[TAB]By the third century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, Ursa Minor, to navigate. In the mid-1st century AD Lucan writes of Pompey who questions a sailor about the use of stars in navigation. The sailor replies with his description of the use of circumpolar stars to navigate by. To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a circumpolar star above that degree in the sky. For example, Apollonius would have used ? Draconis to navigate as he traveled west from the mouth of the Alpheus River to Syracuse.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term cruising referred to certain kinds of missions - independent scouting, raiding or commerce protection - fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the cruising warships of a fleet. From the middle of the 19th century, cruiser came to be a classification for the ships intended for this kind of role, though cruisers came in a wide variety of sizes, from the small protected cruiser to armored cruisers which were as large (though not as powerful) as a battleship. By the early 20th century, cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size, smaller than a battleship but larger than a destroyer. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty placed a formal limit on cruisers, which were defined as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8 inches in calibre. These limits shaped cruisers up until the end of World War II. The very large battlecruisers of the World War I era were now classified, along with battleships, as capital ships. In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense, commerce raiding and shore bombardment. The U.S. Navy in the Cold War period built guided-missile cruisers primarily designed to provide air defense, while the navy of the USSR built battlecruisers with heavy anti-ship missiles designed to sink NATO carrier task forces.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Leather tanning is without a doubt one of the oldest human activities. In the beginning, skins obtained from hunting and livestock breeding could be used for clothing or tents, but they became stiff at low temperatures, while they rotted with heat. It was probably then that attempts were made to render them more flexible and stronger by rubbing in animal fats, the first rudimental tanning process is mentioned in Assyrian texts and in Homers Iliad.[PARAGRAPH:1]Another process was smoking, which almost certainly started by accident, and which later became formaldehyde tanning, as this substance is found in the vapors produced by burning green leaves and branches. It was soon discovered that the rotting process could also be stopped by drying, carried out by exposure to the sun or by the dehydrating action of salt. Vegetable tanning was also known in very ancient times although it is not clear how the tanning action of the tannin contained in the bark of some plants (especially oak) was discovered. Another method known since the earliest times is tanning, based on the use of alum, a mineral which is fairly widespread in nature, particularly in volcanic areas.[PARAGRAPH:1]These methods, which gradually became more refined and efficient, allowed skins to be used in the ancient world and continued to do so for century after century up to the present day.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1754 BC (Middle Chronology). It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a seven and a half foot stone stele and various clay tablets. The code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man. Nearly one-half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and sexual behavior. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A few provisions address issues related to military service.[PARAGRAPH:1]Much Babylonian legal precedent remained in force, even through the Persian, Greek and Parthian conquests, which had little effect on private life in Babylonia; and it survived to influence Romans. The laws and customs that preceded the Code may be called "early"; that of the Neo-Babylonian empire (as well as the Persian, Greek, etc.), "late". The law of Assyria was derived from the Babylonian, but it conserved early features long after they had disappeared elsewhere.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The trade of leather tanning has been around for many years but of all the civilizations throughout history, Native Americans have perfected it. Native Americans utilized the brain tanning method. They used handmade tools such as smaller, handsized stones and rocks with beveled edges as scrapers when skinning an animal. The reason for the beveled edges was to make a clean separation between the meat and the hide minimizing the punctures into the hide from tools. In modern days, skinning tools are more precisely made to be more accurate. The Native Americans were very gracious people and utilized every part of each animal that was taken. This means that even the bones were utilized; bones were carved into tools such as scrapers that could be used to scrape the membrane and fat off of the hide during the tanning process. The tool used today for this part of the process is a double handled scraping blade. Instead of scraping off the hair, often times Native Americans would take the hide to a nearby cool stream and submerge the hide using rocks to weight it down while the temperature combined with the swiftness of the stream to float the hair off the hide. Along the lines of using all of an animal, the Native Americans used the brains of an animal as the key element in the hide tanning process that is now replaced by chemicals in modern tanning methods. Native Americans would mash up the brains of an animal in a container of sorts and then mix the mashed brains up with water to create a solution for the hide to soak in, curing the hide. This curing of the hide was the turning point of making a hide into leather. When the hide is done curing in the brain solution, it is strung up on a wooden frame using strips of leather cut into rope. Additionally, sometimes the bones from an animal can be carved into oars for canoes and also shorter paddles used for stretching the fibers of a hide while it is hung up to dry. While drying, it is important to use a paddle style of oar to stretch, press, and work the fibers of the hide until it is completely dried. When the hide was finally done drying, Native Americans would cut down the hide using a sharp stone or bone carved into a knife being careful not to leave any pieces of the hide that were too tough and uncomfortable yet still using as much of the hide as possible. Depending on what the intended use of the hide was supposed to be, the process could be done at this point but also could have one more step involved with it if desired. This next step is to smoke the hide at a very low temperature. Smoking hides always call for low temperatures and dead, dry wood; doing this last step would make a hide more breathable as well as giving a darker color to the item. When tanned properly, the hide will be as soft and smooth as suede. A finished hide can be made into many different items of clothing; actually, it can be made into any article of clothing from loin cloths to leggings to jackets and hats. In some instances, buckskin is more beneficial to use for clothing over conventional textiles. An example of this is winter time boots. A good set of full buckskin boots will allow ones feet to stay warmer than conventional boots because the smoked leather lets the feet breathe and the soles don't have a large piece of rubber sponging all of the bodily warmth from the feet out of the boot and away from the foot. Buckskin boots can also be lined with fur of sorts in modern day to add increased warmth. When making other clothes such as t-shirts and pants of sorts, it is also more beneficial because buckskin is much more durable. Buckskin pants would be very nice in the days of Native Americans because of the durability and longevity of the garment. Over the years, hide tanning has evolved but the brain tanning method used by Native Americans has proved to be the best.</English>

		<English>The Babylonian Empire was, rather than a new idea, a reinvigoration of the old Sumerian Empire, which had also occupied what is today Southern Iraq. Babylonia was formed from a collection of roughly a dozen city states and was named for its capital city of Babylon. Originally a disorganized region, Babylon and Babylonia began to grow as a center for culture, trade, and religion under the rule of Hammurabi in 1728BC. Location of one of the seven ancient wonders - the Hanging Gardens - Babylonia became the jewel of the ancient world.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hammurabi was the first known ruler of united Babylonia as well as its greatest lawgiver. Hammurabi's Code of Laws regulated Babylonian life in such a way as to make the consequences of most criminal acts publicly known. Citizens could then structure their behavior based on these laws leading to a more organized society. So comprehensive was the Babylonian Code that little about its laws or governmental system changed in the entirety of its 1,200 years of existence. Babylon was so revered for this system that cities and states as far as the Mediterranean would emulate it for centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the death of Hammurabi (1750 BC), the empire slowly declined in power and influence until it was eventually conquered by the Kassites (around 1600 BC) from what are now the mountains of Iran. The Kassites ruled over Babylonia for 576 years, reinvigorating the empire under their reign. Although Hammurabi ruled over Babylonia as a series of interconnected city states, the Kassites were the first rulers of Babylonia to transform the country into an organized territory. The Kassites created trade routes to countries as far away as Greece, Armenia and Turkey. Trade with these nations brought further wealth and status to Babylonia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Towards the end of the Kassite era of rule, Babylonia once again began to fall into decline, in part due to external political and military pressure. In 627 BC, the last Kassite ruler died, and Babylonia revolted under the command of a new leader, Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruled Babylonia and brought about another golden era. During his rule, Babylonia became a military power, invading and taking territory in Egypt and Assyria. Not long afterwards, in 539 BC, Cyrus of Persia invaded Babylonia, conquering it, and forever ending Babylonia's existence as an independent territory.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite numerous regime changes, education reached exceptional heights among the Babylonians. Technical achievements such as the creation of a base 60, "sexigesimal," system of mathematics, are still used to this day. Sixty seconds per minute, sixty minutes per hour: modern time, is in fact, Babylonian time.[PARAGRAPH:1]Much like the Sumerian Empire from which they were descended, Babylonia was a nation of fanatical record-keepers. Starting with Hammurabi and continuing down until the empire's dissolution at the hands of Cyrus and the great Persian emperors, every financial transaction, every court verdict, every contract, and just about anything that could be written down, was - on clay tablets. With laws pertaining to almost every aspect of daily living, a significant amount of data was recorded, and much of this has been uncovered and excavated during the modern era. Researchers have even found several optical devices, similar to magnifying glasses, which were used to allow record keepers to write in smaller cuneiform, in order to fit more information on each clay tablet.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babylonia played an important role in the development of law throughout the world. The creation of Hammurabi's Code of Laws, and the zeal with which his successors, both blood-related and not, upheld those laws, demonstrated for all of history how successful and wealthy a nation could become by following an organized system of government. </English>

J.C.), l'empire perd peu &#224; peu de son pouvoir et de son influence jusqu'&#224; sa conqu&#234;te par les Kassites (env.1 600 av. J.C.) issus des montagnes de l'Iran moderne. Les Kassites r&#232;gnent sur la Babylonie pendant 576 ans, renfor&#231;ant l'empire sous leur r&#232;gne.

Le commerce avec ces nations rapporte encore davantage de richesses et d'importance &#224; la Babylonie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Vers la fin du r&#232;gne des Kassites, la Babylonie amorce un nouveau d&#233;clin, en partie &#224; cause de la pression politique et militaire ext&#233;rieure. En 627 av. J.C., le dernier chef kassite meurt et la Babylonie se rebelle sous le commandement d'un nouveau chef, Nabopolassar. Le fils de Nabopolassar, Nabuchodonosor II, r&#232;gne sur la Babylonie et provoque un nouvel &#226;ge d'or. Pendant son r&#232;gne, la Babylonie devient une puissance militaire, envahissant et annexant une partie de l'Egypte et de l'Assyrie. Peu de temps apr&#232;s, en 539 av. J.C., Cyrus de Perse envahit la Babylonie, mettant un terme d&#233;finitif &#224; son existence en tant que territoire ind&#233;pendant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Malgr&#233; de nombreux changements de r&#233;gime, l'&#233;ducation babylonienne atteint des sommets exceptionnels.

		<German>Das babylonische Reich war weniger eine neue Idee als eine Neuauflage des alten Sumerischen Reiches, das ebenfalls das Gebiet des heutigen S&#252;diraks umfasst hatte. Babylonien entstand aus einer Sammlung von grob einem Dutzend Stadtstaaten und wurde nach der Hauptstadt Babylon benannt. Babylon und Babylonien, urspr&#252;nglich eine wenig organisierte Region, entwickelten sich unter der Herrschaft Hammurabis 1728 v. Chr. zu einem kulturellen, religi&#246;sen und kommerziellen Zentrum. Als Standort eines der sieben Wunder der alten Welt - der H&#228;ngenden G&#228;rten - wurde Babylonien zu einem Juwel der Antike.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hammurabi war der erste bekannte Herrscher eines vereinten Babylonien, und dessen gr&#246;&#223;ter Gesetzgeber. Der Kodex Hammurabi regelte das Leben in Babylonien auf eine Weise, dass die Konsequenzen der meisten kriminellen Handlungen &#246;ffentlich bekannt wurden. Die B&#252;rger konnten daraufhin ihr Verhalten an diesen Gesetzen ausrichten, was zu einer gr&#246;&#223;eren Best&#228;ndigkeit innerhalb der Gesellschaft f&#252;hrte. Der Kodex war so umfassend, dass in den gesamten 1.200 Jahren seiner Existenz nur wenig an seinen Gesetzen oder dem Regierungssystem ver&#228;ndert wurde. Babylonien wurde f&#252;r dieses System so verehrt, dass sogar weit entfernt im Mittelmeer St&#228;dte und Staaten es jahrhundertelang nachahmten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Tod Hammurabis (1750 v. Chr.) verlor das Reich allm&#228;hlich an Macht und Einfluss, bis es schlie&#223;lich von den Kassiten erobert wurde (ungef&#228;hr 1600 v. Chr.), die aus den Bergen des heutigen Iran stammten. Die Kassiten herrschten 576 Jahre lang &#252;ber Babylonien und unter ihrer Herrschaft gewann das Reich neue Kraft. Hammurabi hatte Babylonien zwar als einen Verbund von Stadtstaaten regiert, doch die Kassiten waren die ersten Herrscher Babyloniens, die das Land in ein organisiertes Territorium verwandelten. Die Kassiten erschlossen Handelswege bis in so entfernte L&#228;nder wie Griechenland, Armenien und die T&#252;rkei. Der Handel mit diesen V&#246;lkern brachte Babylonien weiteren Reichtum und mehr Ansehen ein.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gegen Ende der kassitischen Herrschafts&#228;ra begann Babylonien erneut zu verfallen, was teils auf &#228;u&#223;eren politischen und milit&#228;rischen Druck zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren war. 627 v. Chr. starb der letzte kassitische Herrscher und in Babylonien erhob sich ein Aufstand unter einem neuen Anf&#252;hrer, Nabopolassar. Nabopolassars Sohn Nebukadnezar II. f&#252;hrte als Herrscher Babyloniens ein weiteres Goldenes Zeitalter herbei. Unter seiner Herrschaft wurde Babylonien zu einer Milit&#228;rmacht, die Gebiete in &#196;gypten und Assyrien angriff und eroberte. Nur wenig sp&#228;ter, 539 v. Chr., fiel Cyrus von Persien in Babylonien ein und beendete nach erfolgreicher Eroberung die Existenz Babyloniens als unabh&#228;ngiges Gebiet ein f&#252;r alle Mal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trotz zahlreicher Regierungswechsel erreichte die Bildung unter Babyloniern einen au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlich hohen Stand. Technische Errungenschaften wie die Schaffung einer auf der Zahl 60 basierenden, "sexagesimalen" Mathematik werden noch heute verwendet. Sechzig Sekunden pro Minute, sechzig Minuten pro Stunden - die moderne Zeitrechnung ist in Wirklichkeit babylonisch.[PARAGRAPH:1]&#196;hnlich wie das Sumerische Reich, aus dem es sich entwickelt hatte, war Babylonien ein Volk fanatischer Chronisten. Von Hammurabi an bis zur Aufl&#246;sung des Reichs durch Cyrus und die gro&#223;en persischen Kaiser wurde jede finanzielle Transaktion, jedes Gerichtsurteil, jeder Vertrag und so ziemlich alles, was schriftlich festgehalten werden konnte, niedergeschrieben - auf Lehmtafeln. Da beinahe jeder Aspekt des Alltagslebens gesetzlich geregelt war, wurde eine bedeutende Menge Daten festgehalten, und in der Gegenwart wurde ein Gro&#223;teil entdeckt und ausgegraben. Forscher haben sogar verschiedene optische Ger&#228;te gefunden, die Lupen &#228;hneln und die benutzt wurden, um es Chronisten zu erm&#246;glichen, in kleinerer Keilschrift zu schreiben, damit auf eine Lehmtafel mehr Informationen passten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babylonien spielte bei der weltweiten Entwicklung von Gesetzen eine gro&#223;e Rolle. Die Schaffung des Kodex Hammurabi und der Eifer, mit dem seine Nachfolger, blutsverwandt oder nicht, an diesen Gesetzen festhielten, zeigte der gesamten Geschichte, wie reich eine Nation werden konnte, wenn sie sich an ein organisiertes Regierungssystem hielt.</German>
		<Italian>L'Impero Babilonese, pi&#249; che essere un nuovo regno, era un rafforzamento del vecchio Impero Sumero, che occupava anche l'attuale Iraq meridionale. Babilonia era composta da circa una dozzina di citt&#224;-stato e prendeva il nome dalla propria capitale. Pur essendo originariamente una regione disorganizzata, Babilonia cominci&#242; a crescere come centro culturale, commerciale e religioso sotto il regno di Hammurabi, nel 1728 a.C. Babilonia ospitava una delle antiche sette meraviglie del mondo, i giardini pensili, e divenne un gioiello del mondo antico.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hammurabi fu il primo re conosciuto di una Babilonia unita, cos&#236; come il suo pi&#249; grande legislatore. Il Codice di Hammurabi regol&#242; la vita dei Babilonesi in un modo tale da rendere pubblicamente conosciute le conseguenze della maggior parte degli atti criminali. I cittadini potevano cos&#236; regolare il proprio comportamento su tali leggi, il che port&#242; a una societ&#224; pi&#249; organizzata. Il Codice di Hammurabi era cos&#236; completo che cambi&#242; ben poco durante i 1200 anni in cui venne utilizzato. Babilonia era cos&#236; onorata per questo sistema che citt&#224; e stati fino al Mediterraneo l'avrebbero emulata per secoli.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dopo la morte di Hammurabi (1750 a.C.), il potere e l'influenza dell'impero diminuirono lentamente fino a quando fu conquistato dai Cassiti (intorno al 1600 a.C.), provenienti da quelle che oggi sono le montagne dell'Iran. I Cassiti regnarono su Babilonia per 576 anni, rinvigorendo l'impero con il loro regno. La Babilonia di Hammurabi era composta da una serie di citt&#224;-stato tra loro collegate, mentre i Cassiti furono i primi regnanti di Babilonia a trasformare il Paese in un territorio organizzato. Crearono delle rotte commerciali fino a Paesi lontani come Grecia, Armenia e Turchia. Il commercio con queste nazioni fece aumentare ulteriormente l'importanza e la ricchezza di Babilonia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Verso la fine dell'era dei Cassiti, Babilonia cominci&#242; ancora una volta a decadere, in parte a causa della pressione politica e militare esterna. Nel 627 a.C. mor&#236; l'ultimo regnante dei Cassiti e Babilonia si ribell&#242; sotto il comando di un nuovo capo, Nabopolassar. Il figlio di Nabopolassar, Nabucodonosor II, regn&#242; su Babilonia e diede inizio a un'altra epoca d'oro. Durante il suo governo, Babilonia divent&#242; una potenza militare, invadendo e occupando territori in Egitto e Assiria. Dopo non molto, nel 539 a.C., Ciro di Persia invase la Babilonia e la conquist&#242;, ponendo per sempre fine alla sua esistenza come territorio indipendente.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante numerosi cambiamenti di regime, l'educazione raggiunse vette eccezionali presso i Babilonesi. Conquiste tecniche come la creazione di un sistema matematico "sessagesimale", su base 60, vengono utilizzati ancora oggi. Sessanta secondi al minuto, sessanta minuti in un'ora: il tempo moderno &#232; infatti il tempo babilonese.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Babilonesi, proprio come i Sumeri da cui discendevano, archiviavano tutto, quasi con fanatismo. Cominciando con Hammurabi e continuando fino alla sparizione dell'impero per mano di Ciro e dei grandi imperatori persiani, ogni transazione finanziaria, ogni verdetto di corte, ogni contratto e in pratica quasi tutto ci&#242; che poteva essere scritto veniva appunto scritto su tavolette d'argilla. Avendo delle leggi che regolavano quasi ogni aspetto della vita giornaliera, &#232; stata registrata una gran quantit&#224; di dati, molti dei quali sono stati scoperti durante l'era moderna. I ricercatori hanno addirittura trovato diversi apparecchi ottici, simili a lenti di ingrandimento, che venivano utilizzati per scrivere caratteri ancora pi&#249; piccoli, per poter includere ancora pi&#249; informazioni su ogni singola tavoletta.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babilonia ebbe un ruolo importante nello sviluppo della legge in tutto il mondo. La creazione del Codice di Hammurabi, e lo zelo con cui i suoi successori mantennero queste leggi dimostr&#242; a tutti nella storia quanto una nazione potesse ottenere successo e ricchezze seguendo un sistema di governo organizzato. </Italian>

C.) de las monta&#241;as del Ir&#225;n moderno. Los casitas gobernaron Babilonia durante 576 a&#241;os, y con ellos el imperio recobr&#243; su viejo vigor. Aunque Hammurabi hab&#237;a gobernado Babilonia como una serie de ciudades-estado interconectadas, los casitas fueron los primeros que transformaron el pa&#237;s en un territorio organizado. En este per&#237;odo se crearon rutas comerciales hasta lugares tan lejanos como Grecia, Armenia y Turqu&#237;a. El comercio con estas naciones aument&#243; la riqueza y el prestigio de Babilonia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hacia el final del per&#237;odo casita, Babilonia volvi&#243; a caer en declive, en parte por culpa de la presi&#243;n pol&#237;tica y militar proveniente del exterior. En el a&#241;o 627 a. C., a la muerte del &#250;ltimo soberano casita, Babilonia se rebel&#243; bajo el mando de un nuevo l&#237;der, Nabopolassar. La subida al trono del hijo de &#233;ste, Nabucodonosor II, inaugur&#243; una segunda edad de oro en Babilonia.

		<English>The Byzantine Empire, centered around the city of Constantinople, was the successor to the Roman Empire. At its height, the Byzantine Empire reached from Persia to Spain, controlling nearly all the territory that felt the lap of the Mediterranean's warm waters. [PARAGRAPH:1]When the Byzantine Empire began and the Roman Empire ceased is a point of much contention. Some historians place the beginning of the Byzantine Empire in 300 AD, when Constantine I moved the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to a city called Byzantium (later know as Constantinople). Others place the birth of the Byzantine Empire at the end of the reign of Theodosius I, who at his death split the Roman Empire into the Western Empire, ruled from Rome, and the Eastern Empire, ruled from Constantinople. [PARAGRAPH:1]Regardless of historic debate, after the sacking of Rome in 476 AD, the Byzantine Empire was to become the foremost European nation in art, trade and stability - although not necessarily all at once. Taking the throne in 527 AD, Justinian I extended the grip of the Byzantine Empire from Constantinople to the furthest coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. However the Empire would not be able to enjoy the benefits of such territorial expansions for long, as Justinian's successor, Justin II, would begin a trend of placating the various enemies of the Empire - the Sassanid Persians, the Bulgars, and the Arabs, newly organized under Mohammed - with territory in exchange for peace. [PARAGRAPH:1]Territorial losses would continue to weaken the Byzantines until a new lineage of emperors, known as the Macedonian Emperors, arose to invigorate the Empire once again. Basil I founded the Macedonian line in 869. Under the Macedonians, the Byzantine Empire once again began to reach outwards, solidifying its hold on much of the territory neighboring Constantinople. Art flourished in their roughly two centuries of rule, as did the Greek Orthodox Church. [PARAGRAPH:1]The new millennium would be a painful one for Byzantium. Relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church had been deteriorating for many years, and the conflict came to a head with the Great Schism (1054), which finally split the two religions. Militarily, increased assaults by the Seljuk Turks culminated in a resounding defeat for the Empire at the Battle of Manzikert, the Empire losing much of its freshly-gained holdings.[PARAGRAPH:1]But once again, the rise of a powerful new dynasty reversed the Empire's decline. This new dynasty, the Comnenius, sent the call to Western Europe for aid in fighting the Seljuk Turks. Pope Urban II, seeing a chance to reconquer the Holy Lands of Antioch and Jerusalem, as well as halt the squabbling of the European Kings, spread the word for the First Crusade. [PARAGRAPH:1]Through the Crusaders' efforts, the Byzantine Empire regained a portion of its lost territory. But the holy warriors of Western Europe became difficult to control, often threatening to assault the very Empire that had requested their aid. John II and Manuel I, the two most prestigious of the Comnenius emperors, held off the Crusaders and safeguarded the empire from a host of external foes, while ushering in a new era of Byzantine artistic and economic prowess. [PARAGRAPH:1]Manuel I Comnenius was the last great emperor of the Byzantines and the last Comneni. The Angeloi dynasty, successors to the Comneni, proved unable to halt the Empire's slow collapse. In 1204, the knights of the Fourth Crusade, summoned by a disposed Angeloi prince, sacked Constantinople and split the Byzantine Empire into three smaller kingdoms. Nicaea, one of these ex-Byzantine states, recaptured Constantinople years later, but all hopes of reviving the Byzantine Empire would be ended with the capture of the city by the Ottoman leader Mehmed II in 1461.</English>
		<French>L'empire byzantin, centr&#233; autour de la ville de Constantinople, est le successeur de l'empire romain. A son apog&#233;e, l'empire byzantin s'&#233;tend de la Perse &#224; l'Espagne, contr&#244;lant presque tous les territoires qui bordent les eaux chaudes de la M&#233;diterran&#233;e. [PARAGRAPH:1]La question de savoir quand d&#233;bute l'empire byzantin et quand cesse l'empire romain fait l'objet de nombreux d&#233;bats. Certains historiens situent le d&#233;but de l'empire byzantin en 300 ap. J.C, quand Constantin Ier transf&#232;re la capitale de l'empire romain de Rome &#224; une ville nomm&#233;e Byzance (qui deviendra ensuite Constantinople). D'autres situent la naissance de l'empire byzantin &#224; la fin du r&#232;gne de Th&#233;odose Ier qui, &#224; sa mort, divise l'empire romain entre empire occidental (gouvern&#233; par Rome) et empire oriental (gouvern&#233; par Constantinople). Quoi qu'il en soit, apr&#232;s le sac de Rome en 476 ap . J.C. l'empire byzantin va devenir progressivement une nation stable, extr&#234;mement influente dans les domaines artistiques et commerciaux. Acc&#233;dant au tr&#244;ne en 527 ap. J.C., Justinien Ier &#233;tend l'empire byzantin de Constantinople jusqu'aux c&#244;tes les plus recul&#233;es de la mer M&#233;diterran&#233;e. Cependant, l'empire ne jouit pas longtemps des b&#233;n&#233;fices d'une telle expansion territoriale : le successeur de Justinien Ier, Justin II, entreprend d'apaiser les divers ennemis de l'empire (les Perses sassanides, les Bulgares et les Arabes, nouvellement organis&#233;s sous le commandement de Mohammed) en leur offrant des territoires en &#233;change de la paix. [PARAGRAPH:1]Affaiblissant les Byzantins, les pertes territoriales continuent jusqu'&#224; ce qu'une nouvelle lign&#233;e d'empereurs (les empereurs mac&#233;doniens) surgisse pour revigorer l'empire. Basile Ier fonde la lign&#233;e mac&#233;donienne en 869. Sous les Mac&#233;doniens, l'empire byzantin reprend son expansion, consolidant son emprise dans une grande partie du territoire voisin de Constantinople. L'art et l'Eglise orthodoxe grecque connaissent un grand essor au cours de leurs deux si&#232;cles de r&#232;gne.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le nouveau mill&#233;naire va s'av&#233;rer p&#233;nible pour Byzance. Les relations avec l'Eglise catholique romaine et l'Eglise orthodoxe orientale s'&#233;tant d&#233;t&#233;rior&#233;es depuis des ann&#233;es, le conflit &#233;clate &#224; l'occasion du Grand schisme (1054), qui divise les deux religions. Sur le plan militaire, l'intensification des assauts par les Turcs seldjoukides se solde par une d&#233;faite &#233;crasante pour l'empire lors de la bataille de Manzikert. L'empire y perd une grande partie de ses territoires fra&#238;chement conquis.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais une nouvelle fois, l'apparition d'une nouvelle dynastie inverse le d&#233;clin de l'empire. Cette nouvelle dynastie, la dynastie des Comn&#232;nes, fait appel &#224; l'Europe occidentale pour les aider &#224; combattre les Turcs seldjoukides. Le pape Urbain II, voyant l&#224; une occasion de reconqu&#233;rir les terres sacr&#233;es d'Antioche et de J&#233;rusalem, ainsi que d'interrompre les querelles entre les rois europ&#233;ens, proclame la premi&#232;re croisade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gr&#226;ce aux efforts des crois&#233;s, l'empire byzantin reprend une partie de ses territoires perdus. Mais les guerriers saints de l'Europe occidentale deviennent difficiles &#224; contr&#244;ler : ils menacent &#224; plusieurs reprises d'attaquer l'empire qui avait demand&#233; leur aide. Jean II et Manuel Ier, les deux plus prestigieux empereurs Comn&#232;nes, parviennent &#224; tenir les crois&#233;s &#224; distance et &#224; prot&#233;ger l'empire d'une foule d'ennemis &#233;trangers, tout en inaugurant une nouvelle &#232;re de prouesses artistiques et &#233;conomiques. [PARAGRAPH:1]Manuel Ier Comn&#232;ne est le dernier grand empereur des Byzantins et le dernier Comn&#232;ne. La dynastie des Anges, succ&#233;dant aux Comn&#232;nes, s'av&#232;re incapable d'arr&#234;ter le lent d&#233;clin de l'empire. En 1204, les chevaliers de la quatri&#232;me croisade, appel&#233;s par un prince d&#233;chu, pillent Constantinople et divisent l'empire byzantin en trois Etats. Nic&#233;e, l'un de ces empires anciennement byzantins, reconquiert Constantinople des ann&#233;es plus tard, mais tout espoir de faire rena&#238;tre l'empire byzantin s'envole lors de la capture de la ville par le chef ottoman Mehmet II en 1461.</French>
		<German>Das Byzantinische Reich, in dessen Zentrum die Stadt Konstantinopel lag, war der Nachfolger des R&#246;mischen Reichs. Zu seiner Bl&#252;tezeit erstreckte sich das Byzantinische Reich von Persien nach Spanien und kontrollierte beinahe alle Gebiete, die von den warmen Wellen des Mittelmeers besp&#252;lt wurden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Wann das Byzantinische Reich begann und wann das R&#246;mische Reich aufh&#246;rte, ist stark umstritten. Manche Historiker legen den Beginn des Byzantinischen Reiches auf das Jahr 300 n. Chr., als Konstantin I. die Hauptstadt des R&#246;mischen Reiches aus Rom in eine Stadt namens Byzanz verlegte (das sp&#228;tere Konstantinopel). Andere verlegen die Geburt des Byzantinischen Reiches an das Ende der Herrschaft Theodosius I., der bei seinem Tod das R&#246;mische Reich in ein von Rom aus regiertes Westreich und ein von Konstantinopel aus regiertes Ostreich aufteilte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Welches Ende die historische Debatte auch nehmen mag, nach der Pl&#252;nderung Roms im Jahr 476 n. Chr. wurde das Byzantinische Reich zur f&#252;hrenden europ&#228;ischen Nation in Sachen Kunst, Handel und Stabilit&#228;t - jedoch nicht unbedingt alles gleichzeitig. Justinian bestieg den Thron im Jahr 527 n. Chr. und erweiterte den Machtbereich des Byzantinischen Reiches von Konstantinopel aus auf die entlegensten K&#252;sten des Mittelmeers. Das Reich konnte sich jedoch nicht lange an den Vorteilen dieser Gebietserweiterungen erfreuen, da Justinians Nachfolger, Justin II., den sp&#228;teren Brauch begr&#252;ndete, verschiedene Feinde des Reiches zu bes&#228;nftigen - die Sassanidischen Perser, die Bulgaren und die unter Mohammed neu organisierten Araber - indem man jeweils Landbesitz gegen Frieden tauschte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gebietsverluste schw&#228;chten die Byzantiner weiter, bis ein neues Kaisergeschlecht, bekannt als die Makedonischen Kaiser, sich erhob, um dem Reich neues Leben einzuhauchen. Basileos I. begr&#252;ndete im Jahr 869 die Makedonische Dynastie. Unter den Makedonen erweiterte sich das Byzantinische Reich erneut nach au&#223;en und festigte seinen Zugriff auf den Gro&#223;teil des Konstantinopel umgebenden Gebiets. In den ungef&#228;hr zweihundert Jahren ihrer Herrschaft erlebte die Kunst eine Bl&#252;tezeit, ebenso die Griechisch-Orthodoxe Kirche.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das neue Jahrtausend sollte f&#252;r Byzanz schmerzhaft sein. Die Beziehungen zwischen der R&#246;misch-Katholischen und der &#214;stlich-Orthodoxen Kirche hatten sich seit vielen Jahren verschlechtert und der Streit erreichte seinen H&#246;hepunkt mit dem Morgenl&#228;ndischen Schisma (1054), das die zwei Religionen endg&#252;ltig voneinander trennte. Auf der milit&#228;rischen Seite gipfelten die zunehmenden Angriffe der seldschukischen T&#252;rken in der Schlacht von Manzikert in einer vernichtenden Niederlage f&#252;r das Reich, das viel von seinen frisch eroberten Besitzungen wieder verlor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jedoch kehrte erneut der Aufstieg einer m&#228;chtigen neuen Dynastie den Abstieg des Reiches um. Diese neue Dynastie, die Komnenen, sandte den Ruf mit der Bitte um Unterst&#252;tzung gegen die seldschukischen T&#252;rken nach Westeuropa. Papst Urban II., der darin die M&#246;glichkeit sah, das Heilige Land in Antiochia und Jerusalem zur&#252;ckzuerobern und gleichzeitig die inneren Querelen der europ&#228;ischen K&#246;nige zu beenden, rief daraufhin zum Ersten Kreuzzug auf. [PARAGRAPH:1]Durch die Anstrengungen der Kreuzfahrer gewann das Byzantinische Reich einen Teil seiner verlorenen Gebiete zur&#252;ck. Doch die heiligen Krieger Westeuropas wurden immer schwerer zu b&#228;ndigen und drohten oft, eben jenes Reich, das um ihre Hilfe gebeten hatte, anzugreifen. Johannes II. und Manuel I., die zwei bedeutendsten Komnenischen Kaiser, wehrten die Kreuzfahrer ab und sicherten das Reich vor einer F&#252;lle &#228;u&#223;erer Feinde, w&#228;hrend sie gleichzeitig eine neue Bl&#252;tezeit der Byzantinischen Kunst und der Wirtschaft einl&#228;uteten. [PARAGRAPH:1]Manuel I. Komnenos war der letzte gro&#223;e Kaiser der Byzantiner und der letzte Komnene. Die Dynastie der Angeloi, der Nachfolger der Komnenen, erwies sich als nicht in der Lage, den langsamen Zerfall des Reichs aufzuhalten. 1204 pl&#252;nderten die Ritter des Vierten Kreuzzugs auf Gehei&#223; eines abgesetzten Angeloi-Prinzen Konstantinopel und teilten das Byzantinische Reich auf drei kleinere K&#246;nigreiche auf. Nikaia, einer dieser ehemals byzantinischen Staaten, eroberte Jahre sp&#228;ter Konstantinopel zur&#252;ck, doch alle Hoffnung auf eine Neubelebung des Byzantinischen Reiches sollte 1453 mit der Eroberung der Stadt durch den osmanischen Herrscher Mehmet II. zu Ende gehen.</German>
		<Italian>L'Impero Bizantino, costruito attorno alla citt&#224; di Costantinopoli, succedette all'Impero Romano. Al suo culmine l'Impero Bizantino si estendeva dalla Persia alla Spagna e controllava quasi tutto il territorio che si affacciava sulle calde acque del Mediterraneo. [PARAGRAPH:1]La questione su quando sia iniziato l'Impero Bizantino e quando sia finito quello Romano &#232; molto controversa. Alcuni storici pongono l'inizio dell'Impero Bizantino nel 300 d.C., quando Costantino spost&#242; la capitale dell'impero da Roma a una citt&#224; chiamata Bisanzio (pi&#249; tardi conosciuta come Costantinopoli). Altri pongono la nascita dell'Impero Bizantino alla fine del regno di Teodosio, che alla sua morte divise l'Impero Romano in Occidentale, comandato da Roma, e Orientale, governato da Costantinopoli. [PARAGRAPH:1]A prescindere dai dibattiti storici, dopo il sacco di Roma nel 476 d.C., l'Impero Bizantino divenne la nazione pi&#249; importante in Europa per l'arte, il commercio e la stabilit&#224;. Salito al trono nel 527 d.C., Giustiniano estese il dominio dell'Impero Bizantino da Costantinopoli alla costa pi&#249; lontana del Mar Mediterraneo. L'impero per&#242; non godette a lungo dei benefici di una tale espansione territoriale, visto che il successore di Giustiniano, Giustino II, inizi&#242; la tendenza a placare i diversi nemici dell'impero (i Persiani Sasanidi, i Bulgari e gli Arabi, di recente organizzatisi sotto Maometto) scambiando territori con la pace. [PARAGRAPH:1]Le perdite territoriali avrebbero continuato a indebolire i Bizantini fino a quando una nuova stirpe di imperatori, i Macedoni, sorse a rinvigorire ancora una volta l'impero. Basilio I fond&#242; la stirpe macedone nell'869 d.C.; sotto i Macedoni l'Impero Bizantino cominci&#242; ancora una volta a espandersi, consolidando il proprio dominio su gran parte del territorio attorno a Costantinopoli. Nei circa due secoli in cui regnarono i Macedoni fiorirono l'arte e la Chiesa greca ortodossa. [PARAGRAPH:1]Il nuovo millennio sarebbe stato doloroso per Bisanzio. Le relazioni tra la Chiesa Cattolica Romana e la Chiesa Orientale Ortodossa andavano peggiorando da molti anni, e il conflitto arriv&#242; al culmine con il Grande Scisma (1054), che divise le due religioni. Dal punto di vista militare, si andarono moltiplicando gli assalti da parte dei Turchi selgiuchidi, che culminarono in una cocente sconfitta nella Battaglia di Manzikert, per cui l'impero perse gran parte delle terre da poco conquistate.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ma ancora una volta, l'ascesa di una nuova potente dinastia rovesci&#242; le sorti dell'impero. La nuova dinastia, quella dei Comneni, invi&#242; una richiesta di aiuto all'Europa occidentale per combattere i Turchi selgiuchidi. Il papa Urbano II intravide la possibilit&#224; di riconquistare le Sacre Terre di Antiochia e Gerusalemme, e di fermare gli scontri dei re europei e istitu&#236; cos&#236; la Prima Crociata. [PARAGRAPH:1]Grazie agli sforzi dei crociati, l'Impero Bizantino riacquist&#242; una parte dei territori perduti. Ma i guerrieri religiosi dell'Europa occidentale divennero difficili da controllare e spesso minacciavano di attaccare lo stesso impero che aveva richiesto il loro aiuto. Giovanni II e Manuele I, i due pi&#249; importanti imperatori Comneni, tennero a bada i crociati e salvaguardarono l'impero da molti nemici, mentre introducevano una nuova era di valore artistico ed economico per Bisanzio. [PARAGRAPH:1]Manuele I Comneno fu l'ultimo grande imperatore bizantino e l'ultimo dei Comneni. La dinastia degli Angelo, successa a quella dei Comneni, si dimostr&#242; incapace di fermare il lento collasso dell'impero. Nel 1204 i cavalieri della Quarta Crociata, richiamati da un principe Angelo deposto, saccheggiarono Costantinopoli e divisero l'Impero Bizantino in tre regni pi&#249; piccoli. Quello di Nicea riconquist&#242; Costantinopoli anni pi&#249; tardi, ma tutte le speranze di far rivivere l'Impero Bizantino terminarono con la cattura della citt&#224; da parte del sultano Ottomano Mehmed II, nel 1461.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El Imperio Bizantino, construido alrededor de la ciudad de Constantinopla, fue el sucesor del Imperio Romano. En su apogeo, el imperio se extend&#237;a desde Persia hasta Espa&#241;a, y controlaba casi todos los territorios ba&#241;ados por las c&#225;lidas aguas del Mediterr&#225;neo. [PARAGRAPH:1]El momento exacto en el que nace el Imperio Bizantino y desaparece el Imperio Romano es un tema muy controvertido. Algunos historiadores sit&#250;an el nacimiento del bizantino en el a&#241;o 300 d. C., cuando Constantino I traslad&#243; la capital del Imperio Romano a una ciudad llamada Bizancio(conocida m&#225;s adelante como Constantinopla). Para otros, el nacimiento del imperio se produjo al finalizar el reinado de Teodosio I, cuando se dividi&#243; el Imperio Romano en dos mitades, la occidental gobernada desde Roma, y la oriental, desde Constantinopla. [PARAGRAPH:1]Al margen de este debate hist&#243;rico, tras el saqueo de Roma (476 d. C.), el Imperio Bizantino se vio catapultado al primer lugar de Europa en los &#225;mbitos del arte, el comercio y la estabilidad... aunque no siempre al mismo tiempo. Tras subir al trono en el a&#241;o 527 d. C., Justiniano I extendi&#243; la autoridad del imperio desde Constantinopla hasta los &#250;ltimos confines del Mediterr&#225;neo. Sin embargo, el imperio no podr&#237;a disfrutar durante mucho tiempo de los beneficios de esta expansi&#243;n, puesto que el sucesor de Justiniano, Justino II, inici&#243; una pol&#237;tica de apaciguamiento con los diferentes enemigos de Bizancio (la Persia sas&#225;nida, los b&#250;lgaros, y los &#225;rabes, unidos bajo una misma bandera por Mahoma) comprando su indulgencia con tierras. [PARAGRAPH:1]Las p&#233;rdidas territoriales continuar&#237;an debilitando a los bizantinos hasta que el advenimiento de una nueva dinast&#237;a, llamada maced&#243;nica, volviera a vigorizar el imperio. Basilio I fund&#243; esta dinast&#237;a en el 869. Bajo los emperadores maced&#243;nicos, el Imperio Bizantino volvi&#243; a expandirse y consolid&#243; su autoridad sobre la mayor parte de los territorios que rodeaban Constantinopla. Durante los casi dos siglos que dur&#243; esta dinast&#237;a, florecieron el arte y la Iglesia ortodoxa griega. [PARAGRAPH:1]Sin embargo, el nuevo milenio ser&#237;a duro para Bizancio. Las relaciones entre la Iglesia cat&#243;lica romana y la Iglesia ortodoxa oriental llevaban deterior&#225;ndose muchos a&#241;os, y el conflicto lleg&#243; a su punto &#225;lgido en el Gran Cisma(1054), que dividi&#243; definitivamente ambas religiones. Desde el punto de vista militar, el aumento de los ataques de los turcos sely&#250;cidas culmin&#243; en la sonora derrota del imperio en la batalla de Manzikert, donde Bizancio perdi&#243; gran parte de las tierras que acababa de ganar.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pero, una vez m&#225;s, la aparici&#243;n de una nueva dinast&#237;a volvi&#243; a revertir el declive del imperio. Esta dinast&#237;a, la de los Comneno, recurri&#243; a Europa occidental en busca de ayuda contra los turcos sely&#250;cidas. El papa Urbano II, viendo la ocasi&#243;n de reconquistar Tierra Santa (Antioqu&#237;a y Jerusal&#233;n) y de poner fin a los mezquinos enfrentamientos entre los monarcas de Europa, empez&#243; a predicar la Primera Cruzada. [PARAGRAPH:1]Gracias a los esfuerzos de los cruzados, s, el Imperio Bizantino pudo recuperar parte de sus territorios. Pero los guerreros de Europa occidental eran muy dif&#237;ciles de controlar, y en muchas ocasiones amenazaron con atacar el mismo imperio que hab&#237;a solicitado su ayuda. Juan II y Manuel I, los dos Comneno m&#225;s prestigiosos, mantuvieron a raya a los cruzados y defendieron al imperio de un sinf&#237;n de enemigos extranjeros, al tiempo que impulsaban una nueva era de gloria art&#237;stica y desarrollo econ&#243;mico. [PARAGRAPH:1]Manuel I Comneno fue el &#250;ltimo gran emperador de Bizancio, as&#237; como el &#250;ltimo de los miembros de su dinast&#237;a. La dinast&#237;a de los Angelo, sucesores de los Comneno, fue incapaz de frenar el lento declive del imperio. En 1204, los caballeros de la Cuarta Cruzada, llamados por un depuesto pr&#237;ncipe Angelo, saquearon Constantinopla y dividieron el imperio en reinos menores. Nicea, uno de estos estados, recuper&#243; Constantinopla a&#241;os despu&#233;s, pero todas las esperanzas de reverdecer los laureles del imperio se desmoronaron tras la ca&#237;da de la ciudad en manos del sult&#225;n otomano Mehmet II en 1461.</Spanish>

		<English>Originally several separate territories under the control of the Holy Roman Empire, and then united into one state under Habsburg rule (16th century), the Netherlands did not acquire national independence until the conclusion of the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648 AD) when the Spanish formally renounced all claims to Dutch sovereignty in the Treaty of M&#252;nster.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Eighty Years' War was sparked by Spanish religious oppression and an occupation by Spanish forces led by the Duke of Alba, during which over one thousand people were sentenced to death, including two prominent and popular Dutch nobles; these actions caused dissention among the Dutch people. In 1568 Willem, Prince of Orange, returned from a self-imposed exile (in order to avoid prosecution by the Duke of Alba) and led the uprising against the Spanish occupation.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Dutch fight for independence can be seen as a war against religious oppression, with the Pacification of Ghent treaty being a written representation of this sentiment. Signed on November 8th, 1576 the document specified an alliance between the Dutch provinces, in which religious differences would be put aside for the purposes of expelling the Spanish and restoring local provincial control to the Netherlands.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the seventeenth century the Dutch began using their large military and merchant navies to both create their own trading posts along the African coast and rob those of the Portuguese in an effort to reach valuable markets in India and Indonesia. The inrush of treasure, trade and knowledge from these trading and military expeditions was extremely beneficial, and during this first half of the seventeenth century the Dutch experienced a Golden Age of cultural and economic growth. This Golden Age would soon come to a crushing end.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1795, France, under Napoleon I, conquered the Dutch mainland. The Netherlands quickly declined in influence and power, locally and internationally, with the British taking most of their colonial possessions. After Napoleon was defeated a few colonial territories were restored to the Dutch and remained under their control until the decolonization of the twentieth century.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many historians regard the Dutch empire as the first truly capitalist country. In addition to developing the first stock exchange, many modern services such as corporate insurance and retirement funds were attributed to Dutch inventiveness.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Netherlands is also the birthplace of one of the world's early democratic institutions - the Dutch Water Boards. Due to the unique topography of the Netherlands - about half of the mainland is a foot or more under sea level - the country's waterways must be constantly monitored and controlled in order to prevent flooding that would result in tremendous loss of life and property. Each Water Board is in charge of one of the nation's 27 water districts and all matters pertaining to local water management. The creation of these water boards predates the Netherlands itself. [PARAGRAPH:1]The modern Netherlands, with a diverse population and liberal laws towards drugs, prostitution, abortion, same-sex marriage, and euthanasia, has been a constant haven for refugees from other countries. Cultural minorities are encouraged to protect their own cultural identity while at the same time integrate into Dutch culture at large, further reinforcing the open-minded ideals for which Dutch ancestors fought and died.</English>
		<French>A l'origine, les Pays-Bas &#233;taient constitu&#233;s de plusieurs territoires, d'abord s&#233;par&#233;s sous le contr&#244;le du Saint Empire romain germanique, puis unifi&#233;s sous le r&#232;gne des Habsbourg (16&#232;me si&#232;cle). Les Pays-Bas n'acqui&#232;rent leur ind&#233;pendance qu'&#224; la fin de la Guerre de quatre-vingts ans (1568-1648) quand les Espagnols renoncent officiellement &#224; toute pr&#233;tention sur la souverainet&#233; n&#233;erlandaise en signant le Trait&#233; de M&#252;nster.[PARAGRAPH:1]La Guerre de quatre-vingts ans est d&#233;clench&#233;e par l'oppression religieuse Espagnole et par l'occupation des troupes hispaniques (men&#233;es par le duc d'Albe), au cours de laquelle plus de mille personnes sont condamn&#233;es &#224; mort, y compris deux membres importants de la noblesse n&#233;erlandaise, provoquant le soul&#232;vement du peuple n&#233;erlandais. En 1568, Guillaume, prince d'Orange, revient d'un exil qu'il s'&#233;tait lui-m&#234;me impos&#233; (afin d'&#233;viter d'&#234;tre poursuivi par le duc d'Albe) et m&#232;ne la r&#233;volte contre l'occupation espagnole.[PARAGRAPH:1] La lutte n&#233;erlandaise pour l'ind&#233;pendance peut &#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233;e comme une guerre contre le sentiment d'oppression religieuse, sentiment dont le trait&#233; de Pacification de Gand sera la repr&#233;sentation &#233;crite. Ce document, sign&#233; le 8 novembre 1576, consacre une alliance entre les provinces n&#233;erlandaises, au sein de laquelle les diff&#233;rents religieux seront mis de c&#244;t&#233; afin de chasser les espagnols et de restaurer un contr&#244;le local sur les Pays-Bas.[PARAGRAPH:1]Au cours du 17&#232;me si&#232;cle, les n&#233;erlandais commencent &#224; utiliser leurs vastes marines militaires et marchandes pour cr&#233;er leurs propres postes de commerce le long de la c&#244;te Africaine et piller les comptoirs portugais, afin d'atteindre les pr&#233;cieux march&#233;s d'Inde et d'Indon&#233;sie. Les revenus financiers, commerciaux et scientifiques de ces exp&#233;ditions commerciales et militaires sont extr&#234;mement substantiels et, durant la premi&#232;re moiti&#233; du dix-septi&#232;me si&#232;cle, les n&#233;erlandais connaissent un &#226;ge d'or provoqu&#233; par une forte croissance &#233;conomique et culturelle. Cet &#226;ge d'or doit bient&#244;t s'achever dans le sang.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1795 la France, sous Napol&#233;on Ier, conquiert les Pays-Bas continentaux. Les Pays-Bas perdent rapidement pouvoir et influence, localement et mondialement, tandis que les Anglais s'emparent de leurs possessions coloniales. Apr&#232;s la d&#233;faite de Napol&#233;on, quelques colonies sont rendues aux N&#233;erlandais et demeurent sous leur contr&#244;le jusqu'&#224; la d&#233;colonisation du vingti&#232;me si&#232;cle.[PARAGRAPH:1]De nombreux historiens consid&#232;rent l'empire n&#233;erlandais comme le premier pays r&#233;ellement capitaliste. En plus de la premi&#232;re Bourse, de nombreux services modernes comme les assurances et les fonds de retraite sont attribu&#233;s &#224; l'innovation n&#233;erlandaise.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Pays-bas sont aussi la patrie de l'une des premi&#232;res institutions d&#233;mocratiques mondiales : les Conseils de l'eau n&#233;erlandais. En raison de la topographie unique des Pays-Bas (environ la moiti&#233; du continent est situ&#233;e trente centim&#232;tres ou plus au-dessous du niveau de la mer), les voies navigables doivent &#234;tre constamment surveill&#233;es et contr&#244;l&#233;es afin d'&#233;viter une inondation qui provoquerait des pertes humaines et mat&#233;rielles consid&#233;rables.

		<German>Die Niederlande, ehemals sieben unabh&#228;ngige Territorien unter der Herrschaft des Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches, die unter habsburgischer Herrschaft (16. Jahrhundert) vereint wurden, erreichten ihre nationale Unabh&#228;ngigkeit erst mit dem Ende des Achtzigj&#228;hrigen Krieges (1568 - 1648 n. Chr.), als die Spanier im Vertrag von M&#252;nster offiziell auf alle Anspr&#252;che an Holland verzichteten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Achtzigj&#228;hrige Krieg entbrannte aufgrund religi&#246;ser Verfolgung durch Spanien und der Besetzung durch spanische Truppen unter der F&#252;hrung des Herzogs von Alba, w&#228;hrend derer &#252;ber tausend Menschen zum Tode verurteilt wurden, darunter zwei beliebte holl&#228;ndische Adlige. Diese Ereignisse sch&#252;rten Unzufriedenheit beim holl&#228;ndischen Volk. 1568 kehrte Wilhelm, Prinz von Oranien, aus einem selbst auferlegten Exil zur&#252;ck (auf diese Weise war er der Verfolgung durch den Herzog von Alba entgangen) und f&#252;hrte den Aufstand gegen die spanische Besatzung an.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der holl&#228;ndische Kampf um Unabh&#228;ngigkeit kann als Krieg gegen religi&#246;se Unterdr&#252;ckung gesehen werden, von der das Vertragswerk der Genter Pazifikation ein schriftliches Zeugnis bietet. Das Dokument, das am 8. November 1576 unterzeichnet wurde, stellt ein B&#252;ndnis holl&#228;ndischer Provinzen her, f&#252;r das zum Zweck der Vertreibung der Spanier und der Wiederherstellung der &#246;rtlichen Provinzregierung in den Niederlanden die religi&#246;sen Differenzen zur Seite gelegt werden sollten.[PARAGRAPH:1]W&#228;hrend des 17. Jahrhunderts begannen die Holl&#228;nder, ihre gro&#223;en Kriegs- und Handelsflotten zu nutzen, um sowohl eigene Handelsposten entlang der afrikanischen K&#252;ste zu errichten als auch die der Portugiesen zu pl&#252;ndern und wertvolle M&#228;rkte in Indien und Indonesien zu erreichen. Der Zustrom von Reichtum, Handel und Wissen aus diesen Handels- und Kriegsexpeditionen wirkte sich &#228;u&#223;erst g&#252;nstig aus, und w&#228;hrend der ersten H&#228;lfte des 17. Jahrhunderts erlebten die Holl&#228;nder eine Bl&#252;tezeit der Wirtschaft und Kultur. Dieses Goldene Zeitalter sollte jedoch bald ein schreckliches Ende erfahren.[PARAGRAPH:1]1795 eroberte Frankreich unter Napoleon I. das holl&#228;ndische Festland. Die Niederlande verloren rasch an Einfluss und Macht, vor Ort und international, w&#228;hrend die Briten Besitz vom Gro&#223;teil ihrer Kolonien ergriffen. Nachdem Napoleon besiegt worden war, erhielten die Holl&#228;nder einige wenige Kolonien zur&#252;ck, die sie bis zur Dekolonisierung im 20. Jahrhundert behielten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Viele Historiker betrachten das Niederl&#228;ndische Reich als den ersten echten kapitalistischen Staat. Au&#223;er der Entwicklung der ersten B&#246;rse werden dem holl&#228;ndischen Erfindungsgeist viele moderne Dienstleistungen wie Unternehmensversicherungen und Pensionskassen zugeschrieben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Niederlande sind auch der Geburtsort einer der &#228;ltesten demokratischen Einrichtungen der Welt - der Holl&#228;ndischen Wasserverwaltung. Aufgrund der einzigartigen Topografie der Niederlande - etwa die H&#228;lfte des Festlands liegt 30 cm oder mehr unter dem Meeresspiegel - m&#252;ssen die Wasserwege des Landes st&#228;ndig &#252;berwacht und kontrolliert werden, um Fluten zu vermeiden, die einen immensen Verlust an Menschenleben und Besitz zur Folge h&#228;tten. Jede Wasserverwaltung ist f&#252;r eines der 27 nationalen Wassergebiete und alle mit der &#246;rtlichen Wasserverwaltung zusammenh&#228;ngenden Angelegenheiten zust&#228;ndig. Diese Wasserverwaltungsgremien sind bereits &#228;lter als die Niederlande selbst.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die modernen Niederlande mit ihrer vielf&#228;ltigen Bev&#246;lkerung und der liberalen Gesetzgebung in Sachen Drogen, Prostitution, Abtreibung, gleichgeschlechtlicher Ehe und Sterbehilfe, sind ein st&#228;ndiger Hafen f&#252;r Fl&#252;chtlinge aus anderen L&#228;ndern. Kulturelle Minderheiten werden darin best&#228;rkt, ihre eigene kulturelle Identit&#228;t zu wahren und sich gleichzeitig in die allgemeine holl&#228;ndische Kultur zu integrieren; eine Haltung, welche die toleranten und offenen Ideale best&#228;rkt, f&#252;r die die holl&#228;ndischen Vorfahren gek&#228;mpft und ihr Leben gegeben haben.</German>
		<Italian>Inizialmente i Paesi Bassi erano territori separati sotto il controllo del Sacro Romano Impero e vennero uniti in un unico stato sotto la guida degli Asburgo (XIV secolo) ma non acquisirono una propria indipendenza fino alla fine della Guerra degli 80 anni (1568-1648 d.C.), quando la Spagna rinunci&#242; formalmente a tutte le pretese sulla sovranit&#224; olandese, con il Trattato di M&#252;nster.[PARAGRAPH:1]La Guerra degli 80 anni fu scatenata dall'oppressione religiosa da parte degli spagnoli e dall'occupazione di forze iberiche guidate dal Duca d'Alba, durante la quale mille persone furono condannate a morte, tra cui due nobili olandesi prominenti e popolari; queste azioni causarono il dissenso della popolazione olandese. Nel 1568 Guglielmo, principe d'Orange, torn&#242; da un esilio autoimposto (per evitare la persecuzione del Duca d'Alba) e guid&#242; la rivolta contro l'occupazione spagnola.[PARAGRAPH:1]La lotta olandese per l'indipendenza pu&#242; essere vista come una guerra contro l'oppressione religiosa e la Pacificazione di Gand, la rappresentazione scritta di tale sentimento. Firmato l'8 novembre del 1576, questo documento stabiliva un'alleanza tra le province olandesi in cui le differenze religiose venivano messe da parte per cercare di cacciare gli spagnoli e di ripristinare il controllo provinciale locale dei Paesi Bassi.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durante il diciassettesimo secolo gli olandesi cominciarono a utilizzare la propria marina mercantile e militare sia per creare delle stazioni commerciali lungo le coste africane sia per derubare quelle portoghesi, nel tentativo di raggiungere i preziosi mercati in India e Indonesia. L'afflusso di tesori, commercio e conoscenza derivanti da queste spedizioni militari e commerciali ebbe un effetto estremamente positivo e, durante la prima met&#224; del diciassettesimo secolo, gli olandesi conobbero un periodo di grande crescita culturale ed economica. Un'et&#224; dell'oro che sarebbe presto tragicamente terminata.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel 1795 la Francia, sotto Napoleone I, conquist&#242; l'Olanda. I Paesi Bassi persero rapidamente influenza e potere, sia a livello locale sia internazionale, e i britannici presero la maggior parte dei loro possedimenti coloniali. Dopo la sconfitta di Napoleone alcuni territori coloniali tornarono agli olandesi e rimasero sotto il loro controllo fino alla decolonizzazione del ventesimo secolo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Molti storici vedono l'impero olandese come il primo paese realmente capitalista. Oltre ad aver sviluppato la prima borsa azionaria, molti altri servizi moderni come le assicurazioni aziendali e i fondi di pensionamento sono da imputare all'inventivit&#224; olandese.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Paesi Bassi sono anche il luogo di nascita di una delle prime istituzioni democratiche al mondo: i Distretti di Controllo delle Acque (Water Boards). A causa dell'insolita topografia del Paese, circa una met&#224; dei Paesi Bassi &#232; di una trentina di centimetri al di sotto del livello del mare: i corsi d'acqua devono essere costantemente controllati per prevenire allagamenti che causerebbero perdite di vite e di propriet&#224;. Ogni distretto si occupa di una delle 27 aree in cui &#232; diviso il Paese e di tutti i problemi inerenti alla gestione locale delle acque. La creazione di tali distretti &#232; antecedente a quella degli stessi Paesi Bassi. [PARAGRAPH:1]I moderni Paesi Bassi, con una popolazione eterogenea e leggi liberali su droga, prostituzione, aborto, matrimoni tra persone dello stesso sesso ed eutanasia accolgono da sempre rifugiati da altri Paesi. Le minoranze culturali sono incoraggiate a difendere la propria identit&#224; culturale, pur integrandosi ampiamente nella cultura olandese, rinforzando in questo modo gli ideali di larghe vedute per cui gli antenati olandesi combatterono e morirono.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Holanda, que originariamente solo era varios territorios separados bajo el control del Sacro Imperio Romano y m&#225;s tarde unificados en un solo estado bajo el dominio de los Habsburgo (siglo XVI), no alcanz&#243; la independencia hasta el final de la Guerra de los Ochenta A&#241;os (1568-1648), cuando, en el tratado de M&#252;nster, los espa&#241;oles renunciaron finalmente a sus pretensiones de soberan&#237;a sobre ella.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lo que desencaden&#243; la Guerra de los Ochenta A&#241;os fue la intolerancia religiosa de los espa&#241;oles y la ocupaci&#243;n del pa&#237;s por parte de las fuerzas del duque de Alba, que sentenci&#243; a muerte a un millar de personas, incluidos dos importantes y populares nobles. Estos actos provocaron el descontento del pueblo. En 1568, Guillermo, pr&#237;ncipe de Orange, regres&#243; del exilio que &#233;l mismo se hab&#237;a impuesto (para no caer en manos del Duque de Alba) y se puso a la cabeza de la revuelta.[PARAGRAPH:1]La lucha por la independencia de los holandeses puede verse como una guerra contra la opresi&#243;n religiosa, sentimiento encarnado en la llamada Pacificaci&#243;n de Gante.

		<English>Ethiopia is believed by many historians to be the birthplace of the human race. Lucy, a 3.2 million year old human skeleton, was discovered in Ethiopia's Afar Depression. However, beyond Lucy, there is little evidence to suggest (one way or another) that Ethiopia was settled until roughly the eighth century BC, when it is theorized that Jewish settlers fleeing Egypt, Sudan, and southern Arabia settled there.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first recorded government in Ethiopia was the Kingdom of Axum in the first century AD. Information on this kingdom is scarce; its founder remains unknown. But under Axum rule, Ethiopia became the first Christian nation in Africa. In roughly 330 AD, Frumentius, a Greek from Tyre, was consecrated the first bishop of Ethiopia by Saint Athanasius. Frumentius spread Christianity in Ethiopia through the construction of churches on land given to him by the Axum emperor. Although Christianity did not become a widespread religion in the region until much later, Frumentius can be considered the originator of Christianity in Ethiopia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although Ethiopia had traditionally been the target for Muslim raids in the region, it was not until 1528 that a full scale invasion was successful. Under the leadership of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, Muslim forces swept through Ethiopia, routing the emperor's forces and sending him into hiding. Unable to re-secure his homeland with Ethiopian forces alone, Emperor Lebna Dengel Dawit II petitioned the Portuguese to assist defeating the invaders. In 1541 the Portuguese deployed an army of 400 musketeers to assist the emperor, and while these forces were defeated at the Battle of Wofla, the Muslims were ultimately forced to retreat when their leader was killed the following year at the Battle of Wayna Daga.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ethiopia had been wracked by a series of internal conflicts throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth century. While not splintering the nation, these conflicts eroded the empire's central power until the feuding families were ultimately defeated by Tewodros II, who ruled Ethiopia between 1855 and 1868. Despite a prestigious military career, Tewodros II committed an egregious political faux pas when, in 1867, he imprisoned several British nationals after Queen Victoria of the England failed to answer a letter he had sent to her. The British swiftly sent an army to rescue the British citizens, and upon the Ethiopian army's defeat, Tewdros II committed suicide.[PARAGRAPH:1]Soon after, in 1870, the Italians, who had bought the Ethiopian costal city of Eritrea from a local Sultan, claimed that the Treaty of Wuchale (1889), an agreement between Italy and Ethiopia on the official boundaries between Ethiopia and Eritera, granted them sovereignty over all of Ethiopia, though in reality it only specified a very small portion of Northern Ethiopia near Eritrea. The Italians sent an army to conquer Ethiopia, but were repelled by Emperor Menelek II at the Battle of Adowa. After their defeat, the Italians signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa (1896) which recognized Ethiopia as an independent state. As it turned out, the Italians would be back.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1936 the Italians once again invaded and occupied Ethiopia, this time under the fascist dictatorship of Mussolini, forcing the emperor to flee to England. The Italians were eventually defeated in 1941 by combined British and Ethiopian forces.[PARAGRAPH:1]Perhaps the most influential Ethiopian Emperor of the modern era was Haile Selassie I. Ruling from 1930 until his death in 1974 (with the exception of the brief Italian occupation), Selassie made great strides in modernizing his nation. New tax programs were implemented and the constitution was revised under his rule.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1972, an enormous drought hit Ethiopia resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 citizens. Local rulers conspired to keep this information from Emperor Selassie, and when the information was finally revealed, the government's credibility with the common citizenry was seriously undermined. Combined with a major economic recession, the chaos within the government due to the drought provided the opportunity for officers within the Ethiopian military to stage a coup and take over the government. Haile Selassie I died on August 27th, 1975 when it is believed that he was suffocated in his sleep while imprisoned by the military government.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 2005 Ethiopia underwent its second multiparty election. Despite claims of corrupted vote counting, much of the international community saw this election as a positive step for Ethiopia's future.</English>
		<French>L'Ethiopie est consid&#233;r&#233;e par de nombreux historiens comme le berceau de la race humaine. Lucy, squelette datant de 3,2 millions d'ann&#233;es, a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;couvert dans la d&#233;pression &#233;thiopienne de l'Afar. Cependant, mis &#224; part Lucy, il y a peu de preuves (d'une fa&#231;on ou d'une autre) d'une fondation de l'Ethiopie ant&#233;rieure au huiti&#232;me si&#232;cle avant J.C., date &#224; laquelle les colons juifs auraient fui l'Egypte, le Soudan et le sud de l'Arabie pour s'installer dans cette r&#233;gion.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le premier gouvernement d'Ethiopie dont on ait retrouv&#233; trace est celui du royaume d'Aksoum au premier si&#232;cle ap. J.C. On a tr&#232;s peu d'information sur ce royaume ; ses fondateurs demeurent inconnus. Mais sous le r&#232;gne d'Aksoum, l'Ethiopie devient la premi&#232;re nation catholique d'Afrique. Aux environs de 330 ap. J.C., Frumence, un grec originaire de Tyr, est consacr&#233; premier &#233;v&#234;que d'Ethiopie par Athanase d'Alexandrie. Frumence propage le catholicisme en Ethiopie &#224; travers la construction d'&#233;glises sur des terres que lui avaient l&#233;gu&#233;es l'empereur d'Aksoum. M&#234;me si le christianisme ne se r&#233;pand que bien plus tard, Frumence peut &#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233; comme le fondateur de cette religion en Ethiopie.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'Ethiopie est la cible de perp&#233;tuels raids musulmans dans la r&#233;gion, mais la premi&#232;re r&#233;elle invasion n'a lieu qu'en 1528. Sous le commandement de l'imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, les troupes musulmanes envahissent l'Ethiopie, mettent en d&#233;route les forces de l'empereur et forcent ce dernier &#224; fuir. Incapable de reprendre ses terres avec uniquement des troupes &#233;thiopiennes, l'empereur Lebna Dengel Dawit II demande aux Portugais de l'aider &#224; vaincre les envahisseurs. En 1541, les Portugais d&#233;ploient une arm&#233;e de 400 mousquetaires pour aider l'empereur et malgr&#233; sa d&#233;faite &#224; la bataille de Wofla, les musulmans sont finalement contraints de se retirer lorsque leur chef est tu&#233; l'ann&#233;e suivante, au cours de la bataille de Wayna Daga.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pendant les seizi&#232;me et dix-septi&#232;me si&#232;cles, l'Ethiopie est min&#233;e par de nombreux conflits internes qui, m&#234;me s'ils ne scindent pas la nation, &#233;rodent le pouvoir central. Les familles en guerre sont finalement vaincues par Tewodros II, qui r&#232;gne sur l'Ethiopie entre 1855 et 1868. Malgr&#233; une prestigieuse carri&#232;re militaire, Tewodros II commet un &#233;norme impair politique lorsqu'en 1867, il fait emprisonner des citoyens britanniques parce que la reine Victoria avait omis de r&#233;pondre &#224; l'une de ses lettres. Les Britanniques envoient alors imm&#233;diatement une arm&#233;e pour secourir leurs concitoyens et, lorsque l'arm&#233;e &#233;thiopienne est vaincue, Tewodros II se suicide.[PARAGRAPH:1]Peu apr&#232;s, en 1870, les Italiens, qui ont achet&#233; l'Erythr&#233;e &#224; un sultan &#233;thiopien, proclament que le Trait&#233; de Wuchale (accord sign&#233; an 1889 entre l'Italie et l'Ethiopie et portant sur la d&#233;limitation des fronti&#232;res officielles entre l'Ethiopie et l'Erythr&#233;e) leur accorde la souverainet&#233; sur toute l'Ethiopie, alors qu'en r&#233;alit&#233;, il ne d&#233;signe qu'une toute petite partie du nord du pays. Les Italiens envoient une arm&#233;e conqu&#233;rir l'Ethiopie, mais ils sont repouss&#233;s par l'empereur Menelek II lors de la bataille d'Adowa. Apr&#232;s leur d&#233;faite, les Italiens signent le Trait&#233; d'Addis-Abeba (1896) qui reconna&#238;t l'ind&#233;pendance de l'Ethiopie. Mais les Italiens ne vont pas tarder &#224; revenir.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1936, les Italiens envahissent une nouvelle fois l'Ethiopie, cette fois sous la dictature fasciste de Mussolini, for&#231;ant l'empereur &#224; fuir en Angleterre. Les Italiens sont finalement vaincus en 1941 par les troupes anglaises et &#233;thiopiennes.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'empereur &#233;thiopien le plus influent a sans doute &#233;t&#233; Hail&#233; S&#233;lassi&#233; Ier. R&#233;gnant de 1930 jusqu'&#224; sa mort en 1974 (&#224; l'exception de la br&#232;ve occupation italienne), S&#233;lassi&#233; m&#232;ne de grandes avanc&#233;es dans la modernisation de sa nation. Sous son r&#232;gne, de nouveaux programmes fiscaux sont r&#233;alis&#233;s et la constitution est r&#233;vis&#233;e.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1972, une terrible s&#233;cheresse frappe l'Ethiopie, provoquant la mort de plus de 200 000 citoyens. Les chefs locaux conspirent pour cacher cette information &#224; l'empereur S&#233;lassi&#233; et, lorsqu'il l'apprend enfin, la cr&#233;dibilit&#233; du gouvernement vis-&#224;-vis des citoyens est s&#233;rieusement &#233;branl&#233;e.

		<German>&#196;thiopien gilt bei vielen Historikern als die Wiege der Menschheit. Lucy, ein 3,2 Mio. Jahre altes Skelett, wurde in der &#228;thiopischen Afar-Senke gefunden. Au&#223;er Lucy gibt es jedoch wenig Beweise (in die eine oder andere Richtung), dass &#196;thiopien vor dem 8. Jahrhundert v. Chr. besiedelt wurde, als, so die Theorie, j&#252;dische Siedler aus &#196;gypten, dem Sudan und dem s&#252;dlichen Arabien hierher flohen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die erste urkundlich erw&#228;hnte Regierung in &#196;thiopien war das K&#246;nigreich Aksum im 1. Jahrhundert n. Chr. Es gibt nur wenige Informationen &#252;ber dieses K&#246;nigreich; sein Gr&#252;nder bleibt unbekannt. Doch unter der Herrschaft Aksums wurde &#196;thiopien der erste christliche Staat in Afrika. Um etwa 330 n. Chr. wurde Frumentius, ein Grieche aus Tyrus, vom Heiligen Athanasius zum ersten Bischof &#196;thiopiens geweiht. Durch den Bau von Kirchen auf Land, das ihm der Kaiser von Aksum gegeben hatte, verbreitete Frumentius das Christentum. Obwohl das Christentum erst viel sp&#228;ter in dieser Gegend zur verbreiteten Religion wurde, kann Frumentius als der Begr&#252;nder des Christentums in &#196;thiopien gelten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obwohl &#196;thiopien traditionell ein Ziel muslimischer &#220;berf&#228;lle in der Region gewesen war, war eine Eroberung erst 1528 erfolgreich. Unter der F&#252;hrung des Imams Ahmed Ibn Ibrihim Al-Ghazi drangen muslimische Streitkr&#228;fte in &#196;thiopien ein, schlugen die kaiserlichen Streitkr&#228;fte in die Flucht und zwangen den Kaiser, sich zu verstecken. Da er allein mit den &#228;thiopischen Streitkr&#228;ften nicht in der Lage war, sein Heimatland zur&#252;ckzuerobern, bat Kaiser Lebna Dengel Dawit II. die Portugiesen um Hilfe bei der Vertreibung der Angreifer. 1541 schickten die Portugiesen eine Armee aus 400 Musketieren, um den Kaiser zu unterst&#252;tzen, und obwohl diese Streitkr&#228;fte in der Schlacht von Wofla besiegt wurden, mussten sich die Muslime letztendlich zur&#252;ckziehen, nachdem ihr Anf&#252;hrer im folgenden Jahr in der Schlacht von Wayna Daga get&#246;tet wurde.[PARAGRAPH:1]W&#228;hrend des gesamten 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts war &#196;thiopien von einer Reihe innerer Konflikte heimgesucht worden. Obwohl die Nation nicht zerbrach, zerm&#252;rbten diese Konflikte die zentrale Machtbasis des Kaiserreichs, bis die einander befehdenden Familien von Tewodros II. besiegt wurden, der &#196;thiopien von 1855 bis 1868 regierte. Trotz einer ruhmreichen Milit&#228;rlaufbahn beging Tewodros II. einen &#252;berragenden politischen Fehltritt, als er 1867 mehrere britische Staatsangeh&#246;rige festsetzen lie&#223;, nachdem K&#246;nigin Viktoria von England einen von ihm geschickten Brief nicht beantwortete. Die Briten entsandten rasch eine Armee, um die britischen B&#252;rger zu retten, und nach der Niederlage der &#228;thiopischen Armee beging Tewodros II. Selbstmord.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bald darauf behaupteten die Italiener, die von einem &#246;rtlichen Sultan die &#228;thiopische K&#252;stenstadt Eritrea gekauft hatten, der Vertrag von Wuchale (1889), eine offizielle Vereinbarung zwischen Italien und &#196;thiopien bez&#252;glich des Grenzverlaufs zwischen &#196;thiopien und Eritrea, w&#252;rde ihnen die Hoheit &#252;ber ganz &#196;thiopien verleihen, obwohl sich der Vertrag in Wirklichkeit nur auf einen sehr kleinen Teil Nord&#228;thiopiens in der N&#228;he Eritreas bezog. Die Italiener entsandten eine Armee, um &#196;thiopien zu erobern, wurden jedoch in der Schlacht von Adua von Kaiser Menelik II. besiegt. Nach ihrer Niederlage unterzeichneten die Italiener den Vertrag von Addis Abeba (1896), worin &#196;thiopien als unabh&#228;ngiger Staat anerkannt wurde. Doch wie sich herausstellte, sollten die Italiener wiederkommen.[PARAGRAPH:1]1936 eroberten und besetzten die Italiener &#196;thiopien erneut, diesmal unter der faschistischen Diktatur Mussolinis, und zwangen den Kaiser, nach England zu fliehen. Die Italiener wurden schlie&#223;lich 1941 von vereinten britischen und &#228;thiopischen Streitkr&#228;ften besiegt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Vielleicht der einflussreichste &#228;thiopische Kaiser der Moderne war Haile Selassie I. Er regierte von 1930 bis 1974 (mit einer Unterbrechung w&#228;hrend der kurzen italienischen Besetzung) und machte gro&#223;e Fortschritte bei der Modernisierung seines Landes. Unter seiner Herrschaft wurden neue Steuerprogramme umgesetzt und die Verfassung reformiert.[PARAGRAPH:1]1972 wurde &#196;thiopien Opfer einer enormen D&#252;rre, die den Tod von mehr als 200.000 B&#252;rgern zur Folge hatte. Die Herrscher vor Ort taten sich zusammen, um diese Information vor Kaiser Selassie geheim zu halten, und als die Information schlie&#223;lich ans Licht kam, hatte die Glaubw&#252;rdigkeit der Regierung beim Volk ernsthaften Schaden genommen. In Verbindung mit einer bedeutenden wirtschaftlichen Rezession bot das durch die D&#252;rre entstandene Chaos in der Regierung einigen Offizieren des &#228;thiopischen Milit&#228;rs Gelegenheit, durch einen Coup die Regierung zu st&#252;rzen. Haile Selassie I. starb am 27. August 1975; vermutlich wurde er w&#228;hrend seiner Inhaftierung durch das Milit&#228;rregime im Schlaf erstickt.[PARAGRAPH:1]2005 fanden in &#196;thiopien die zweiten Wahlen mit mehreren Parteien statt. Trotz Beschwerden &#252;ber Korruption bei der Z&#228;hlung wurde dies von einem Gro&#223;teil der internationalen Gemeinschaft als positiver Schritt in die Zukunft &#196;thiopiens gewertet.</German>
		<Italian>Molti storici credono che l'Etiopia sia la culla della razza umana. Nella depressione di Afar &#232; infatti stato trovato Lucy, uno scheletro umano di 3,2 milioni di anni fa. Oltre a Lucy ci sono per&#242; poche prove che suggeriscano (o neghino) che l'Etiopia fosse abitata prima dell'ottavo secolo a.C., quando una teoria vuole che si siano insediati dei profughi ebrei provenienti da Egitto, Sudan e Arabia del sud.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il primo governo di cui si ha testimonianza in Etiopia fu il Regno di Axum, nel primo secolo a.C. Le informazioni sono per&#242; scarse: il fondatore del regno rimane sconosciuto. Sotto il governo di Axum l'Etiopia divenne la prima nazione cristiana in Africa. All'incirca nel 330 d.C. Frumentius, un greco di Tiro, venne consacrato quale primo vescovo di Etiopia da Sant'Attanasio. Frumentius diffuse il cristianesimo in Etiopia attraverso la costruzione di chiese sulle terre che gli furono concesse dall'imperatore di Axum. Nonostante il cristianesimo sia diventato molto diffuso solo pi&#249; tardi, Frumentius pu&#242; esserne considerato il primo diffusore.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante l'Etiopia sia stata tradizionalmente bersaglio di incursioni musulmane, la prima invasione su larga scala ebbe successo solo nel 1528. Al comando dell'Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, le forze musulmane spazzarono l'Etiopia, sconfiggendo quelle dell'imperatore e costringendolo alla fuga. Incapace di riconquistare la patria con le sole forse etiopi, l'imperatore Lebna Dengel Dawit II chiese aiuto ai portoghesi per sconfiggere gli invasori. Nel 1541 i portoghesi inviarono un esercito di 400 moschettieri in aiuto dell'imperatore e, anche se tali forze furono sconfitte nella battaglia di Wofla, i musulmani furono costretti a ritirarsi quando il loro capo venne ucciso, l'anno successivo, nella battaglia di Wayna Daga.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'Etiopia fu sconquassata da una serie di conflitti interni durante il sedicesimo e il diciassettesimo secolo. Pur non dividendo la nazione, tali conflitti erosero il potere centrale dell'impero fino a quando le famiglie in lotta vennero sconfitte da Tewodros II, che govern&#242; dal 1855 al 1868. Nonostante una prestigiosa carriera militare, Tewodros II commise un terribile passo falso dal punto di vista politico quando, nel 1867, imprigion&#242; diversi cittadini britannici dopo che la regina Vittoria non rispose a una sua lettera. La Gran Bretagna invi&#242; un esercito a salvare i propri cittadini e, alla sconfitta della propria armata, Tewodros II si suicid&#242;.[PARAGRAPH:1]Successivamente, gli italiani, che nel 1870 avevano acquistato una citt&#224; costiera dell'Eritrea da un sultano locale, affermarono che il Trattato di Uccialli (1889), un accordo tra Italia ed Etiopia sui confini ufficiali tra Etiopia ed Eritrea, garantiva loro il dominio sull'intera Etiopia, anche se in realt&#224; specificava solamente una porzione davvero piccola dell'Etiopia settentrionale. Gli italiani inviarono un esercito alla conquista dell'Etiopia, ma furono respinti dall'imperatore Menelik II, nella battaglia di Adua. Dopo la sconfitta gli italiani firmarono il Trattato di Addis Abeba (1896), che riconosceva l'Etiopia come stato indipendente. Gli italiani sarebbero per&#242; tornati.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel 1936 gli italiani invasero e occuparono ancora l'Etiopia, stavolta sotto la dittatura fascista di Mussolini, costringendo l'imperatore a fuggire in Inghilterra. Gli italiani vennero poi sconfitti nel 1941 dalle forze congiunte inglesi ed etiopi.[PARAGRAPH:1]Forse il pi&#249; influente imperatore dell'era moderna in Etiopia fu Haile Selassie I. Govern&#242; dal 1930 fino alla sua morte nel 1974 (con la breve parentesi dell'occupazione italiana), e fece grandi passi avanti nella modernizzazione della propria nazione. Vennero implementati nuovi schemi di tassazione e fu rivista la costituzione.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel 1972, un'enorme siccit&#224; colp&#236; l'Etiopia causando la morte di oltre 200.000 persone. I governanti locali cospirarono per mantenere segreta quest'informazione all'imperatore Selassie, ma quando si seppe la credibilit&#224; del governo presso i cittadini ne usc&#236; seriamente compromessa. Il caos all'interno del governo causato dalla siccit&#224;, combinato con una grande recessione economica, diede l'opportunit&#224; ad alcuni ufficiali dell'esercito etiope di fare un colpo di stato. Haile Selassie I mor&#236; il 27 agosto 1975 quando, si dice, venne soffocato nel sonno mentre era prigioniero del governo militare.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel 2005 in Etiopia si tenne la seconda elezione multi-partito. Nonostante illazioni riguardanti un falso conteggio dei voti, la comunit&#224; internazionale ha visto in queste elezioni un momento positivo per il futuro del Paese.</Italian>

Lucy, un esqueleto humanoide de 3,2 millones de a&#241;os de antig&#252;edad, se descubri&#243; en la depresi&#243;n de Afar, en este pa&#237;s. No obstante, Lucy aparte, no hay demasiados indicios que permitan concluir que Etiop&#237;a estuviera habitada hasta el siglo VIII a. C., cuando, seg&#250;n las teor&#237;as m&#225;s aceptadas hoy en d&#237;a, fue colonizada por refugiados jud&#237;os que hu&#237;an de Egipto, Sud&#225;n y Arabia meridional.[PARAGRAPH:1]La primera entidad pol&#237;tica documentada de la historia de Etiop&#237;a fue el reino de Axum, en el siglo I d. C. Apenas existe informaci&#243;n sobre este reino. No sabemos qui&#233;n lo fund&#243;. Lo que s&#237; sabemos es que bajo el gobierno de Axum, Etiop&#237;a se convirti&#243; en la primera naci&#243;n cristiana de &#193;frica. Hacia el a&#241;o 330 d. C., Frumencio, un griego de Tiro, fue consagrado por san Atanasio como primer obispo de Etiop&#237;a. Frumencio foment&#243; la propagaci&#243;n del cristianismo en Etiop&#237;a mediante la construcci&#243;n de iglesias en tierras cedidas a tal efecto por el emperador de Axum. A pesar de que el cristianismo no se convirti&#243; en una religi&#243;n mayoritaria en la regi&#243;n hasta mucho m&#225;s tarde, Frumencio puede considerarse su introductor en Etiop&#237;a.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tradicionalmente, Etiop&#237;a hab&#237;a sufrido frecuentes incursiones por parte de los musulmanes, pero hasta 1528 no se produjo una invasi&#243;n a gran escala. Las fuerzas musulmanas, dirigidas por el im&#225;n Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, invadieron Etiop&#237;a, derrotaron al ej&#233;rcito del emperador y lo obligaron a esconderse. Incapaz de recobrar sus territorios por s&#237; solo, el emperador Lebna Dengel Dawit II solicit&#243; ayuda a los portugueses para vencer a los invasores. En 1541, los portugueses pusieron un ej&#233;rcito de 400 mosqueteros al servicio del emperador, y a pesar de que estas fuerzas fueron derrotadas, finalmente los musulmanes se vieron obligados a retirarse al a&#241;o siguiente cuando su l&#237;der cay&#243; abatido en la batalla de Wayna Daga.[PARAGRAPH:1]En los siglos XVI y XVII, Etiop&#237;a se vio sacudida por una serie de conflictos intestinos. Aunque estas luchas no fragmentaron la naci&#243;n, fueron erosionando el poder centralizado del imperio, al menos hasta que las familias levantiscas fueron totalmente derrotadas por Tewodros II, soberano del pa&#237;s de 1855 a 1868. A pesar de su prestigiosa carrera militar, Tewodros II cometi&#243; un famoso faux pas pol&#237;tico cuando, en 1867, enfurecido por la falta de respuesta de la reina Victoria de Inglaterra a una misiva suya, orden&#243; encarcelar a varios ciudadanos brit&#225;nicos. Los ingleses, sin perder un instante, enviaron un ej&#233;rcito para rescatar a sus conciudadanos y, tras la derrota de las fuerzas et&#237;opes, Tewdros II se suicid&#243;.[PARAGRAPH:1]Poco despu&#233;s, en 1870, los italianos, que hab&#237;an comprado la ciudad costera de Eritrea a un sult&#225;n de la regi&#243;n, reclamaron que el tratado de Wuchale (un acuerdo entre Italia y Etiop&#237;a sobre los l&#237;mites precisos de este pa&#237;s y Eritera), les otorgaba la soberan&#237;a sobre toda Etiop&#237;a, aunque en realidad solo especificaba ciertas regiones septentrionales pr&#243;ximas a Eritrea. Los italianos enviaron un ej&#233;rcito a conquistar Etiop&#237;a, pero fueron vencidos por el emperador Meneliq II en la batalla de Adowa. Tras la derrota, los italianos firmaron el tratado de Addis Abeba (1896), que reconoc&#237;a la independencia de Etiop&#237;a. Sin embargo, no tardar&#237;an en volver.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1936, bajo la direcci&#243;n del dictador fascista Mussolini, invadieron el pa&#237;s por segunda vez, y el emperador se vio obligado a huir a Inglaterra.

		<English>The Holy Roman Empire was created in 800 AD by Charlemagne. Covering much of central Europe from the Netherlands to Hungary, the Empire was both a political powerhouse and a hotbed of political intrigue and military conflict. In some ways "Emperors" in name only, the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire were rarely able to exert real control over any territory that was beyond the reach of their personal armies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the Holy Roman Empire was not referred to as such until late in the reign of Otto I (962-973), it came into being as a political entity in 800 AD when Pope Leo III, in an effort to break ties with the weakening Byzantine Empire, crowned Charlemagne the "Emperor of the Romans." A keen military strategist and devout Catholic, Charlemagne managed to keep the empire united until his death in 814, upon which the empire steadily dissolved into separate warring states until reunited under the rule of Otto I. While Otto I managed to reunite the empire, his downfall, and that of many successor emperors, was his fixation on Italy. Although Italy was not formally part of the empire, Otto I repeatedly invaded that country in order to secure holdings for the Germanic empire. However, the majority of his military ventures into Italy were unsuccessful, and Otto I only succeeded in eroding his power base in Germany.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout its history, the Holy Roman Empire was the stage for conflicts between its Emperors and the Church. Initially it was only the Pope who could designate the Roman Emperor, however over time - especially during the reign of Otto I - it became instead the Emperor who named the next Pope, providing the throne with enormous religious power. During the reign of the Salian Emperors (1024-1125) this practice again changed. A council of churchmen, known as Cardinals, was formed and given the power to nominate and elect popes. This practice has continued with only minor changes to the present day.[PARAGRAPH:1]Charles VI ruled with perhaps the most pragmatic view of his empire. Voted by the Cardinal Council as Holy Roman Emperor in 1355, Charles immediately gave up all imperial ambitions in Italy and instead focused on consolidating power in the Germanic lands and the eastern half of his empire. Accepting that the German cities and territories were the political and military domains of their local rulers, Charles worked with these local leaders to establish a combined dominance instead of attempting to wrest away their power. Unfortunately, upon Charles' death his son Sigismund fell back into the historical fallacy of attempting to control Italy, and the Empire once again continued its decline into irrelevancy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite the internal power struggles wracking the Holy Roman Empire, local rulers banded together in order to face the Napoleonic threat from France. From 1792 to 1802, Austria, Prussia and the other German states combined forces with the hope of defeating the invading French, but to no avail. With little territory left under his control, Emperor Francis II resigned the title of Holy Roman Emperor. The Empire was formally dissolved on the sixth of August, 1806.[PARAGRAPH:1]Over its history, the Holy Roman Empire existed more as an idea than an actual administrative organization. The empire's leaders rarely had actual control over their lands, and constant squabbling between fiefdom holders, as well as the church and state, kept the empire from solidifying any real control over its domain. Its recreation has, however, served as a goal which many would-be conquerors in history have strived to achieve, including Otto von Bismark, King William I, and Adolf Hitler.</English>
		<French>Le Saint Empire romain germanique fut cr&#233;&#233; en 800 ap. J.C. par Charlemagne. Couvrant une grande partie de l'Europe centrale, des Pays-Bas &#224; la Hongrie, l'empire &#233;tait &#224; la fois un grand centre politique et un foyer d'intrigues politiques et de conflits militaires. Les dirigeants du Saint Empire romain, qui n'avaient souvent d'empereur que le nom, furent rarement capables d'exercer un r&#233;el contr&#244;le sur les territoires qui se trouvaient hors de port&#233;e de leurs arm&#233;es personnelles.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bien que le Saint Empire romain ne prit ce nom qu'&#224; la fin du r&#232;gne d'Otton Ier (962-973), il prit naissance en tant qu'entit&#233; politique en 800 ap. J.C. lorsque le pape L&#233;on III, essayant de rompre avec l'empire byzantin affaibli, couronna Charlemagne "empereur des romains". Fin strat&#232;ge et fervent catholique, Charlemagne r&#233;ussit &#224; garder l'empire uni jusqu'&#224; sa mort en 814, apr&#232;s quoi l'empire se d&#233;sint&#233;gra progressivement en plusieurs Etats bellig&#233;rants jusqu'&#224; leur r&#233;unification sous Otton Ier. Bien qu'il r&#233;uss&#238;t &#224; r&#233;unir l'empire, sa chute (et celle de nombreux empereurs par la suite) fut provoqu&#233;e par sa fixation sur l'Italie. M&#234;me si l'Italie ne faisait pas formellement partie de l'empire, Otton Ier envahit ce pays &#224; plusieurs reprises afin de s'accaparer des terres pour l'empire germanique. Cependant, la majorit&#233; de ses incursions en Italie furent des &#233;checs, et Otton Ier ne parvint qu'&#224; affaiblir ses r&#233;seaux d'influence en Allemagne.[PARAGRAPH:1]A travers son histoire, le Saint Empire romain germanique fut le th&#233;&#226;tre de nombreux conflits entre ses empereurs et l'Eglise. A l'origine, seul le pape pouvait d&#233;signer l'empereur romain, mais avec le temps, et surtout pendant le r&#232;gne d'Otton Ier, ce fut l'empereur qui vint &#224; nommer les papes, conf&#233;rant au tr&#244;ne un &#233;norme pouvoir religieux. Pendant le r&#232;gne des empereurs saliens (1024-1125), cette pratique changea &#224; nouveau. Un conseil d'hommes d'Eglise, les cardinaux, fut form&#233; et obtint le pouvoir de nommer et d'&#233;lire les papes. Cette pratique perdure encore de nos jours malgr&#233; quelques changements mineurs.[PARAGRAPH:1] De tous ces empereurs, Charles IV fut peut-&#234;tre celui qui eut la vision la plus pragmatique de son empire. Nomm&#233; empereur du Saint Empire romain germanique en 1355 par le conseil des cardinaux, Charles abandonna imm&#233;diatement toute ambition imp&#233;riale sur l'Italie et s'effor&#231;a de consolider son pouvoir sur les terres germaniques, ainsi que sur la moiti&#233; orientale de son empire. Apr&#232;s avoir accept&#233; de confier la gestion politique et militaire des villes et territoires germaniques &#224; leurs dirigeants locaux, Charles travailla avec ces derniers pour &#233;tablir une pr&#233;dominance conjointe au lieu d'essayer de leur ravir le pouvoir. Malheureusement, apr&#232;s la mort de Charles, son fils Sigismund r&#233;it&#233;ra l'erreur de ses pr&#233;d&#233;cesseurs en essayant de contr&#244;ler l'Italie, et l'empire r&#233;amor&#231;a son lent d&#233;clin.[PARAGRAPH:1]Malgr&#233; les luttes de pouvoir internes qui d&#233;chiraient l'empire, les dirigeants locaux se regroup&#232;rent pour lutter contre la menace napol&#233;onienne venue de France. De 1792 &#224; 1802, l'Autriche, la Prusse et les autres Etats germaniques unirent leurs forces dans l'espoir de vaincre l'envahisseur fran&#231;ais, en vain. Ayant perdu le contr&#244;le de la majeure partie de son territoire, l'empereur Fran&#231;ois II abandonna le titre de saint empereur romain. L'empire fut officiellement dissous le six ao&#251;t 1806.[PARAGRAPH:1]Au cours de son histoire, le Saint Empire romain germanique exista plus en tant qu'id&#233;e qu'en tant que v&#233;ritable organisation administrative. Les dirigeants de l'empire n'exer&#231;aient que tr&#232;s rarement un contr&#244;le effectif sur leurs terres. De plus, les querelles permanentes entre seigneurs, ainsi que les d&#233;saccords entre l'Eglise et l'Etat, emp&#234;ch&#232;rent l'empire de consolider sa domination sur ses terres. Cependant, de nombreux conqu&#233;rants au cours de l'Histoire tentent de le reformer et parmi ces derniers figurent Otto von Bismarck, le roi Guillaume Ier et Adolf Hitler.</French>
		<German>Das Heilige R&#246;mische Reich wurde im Jahr 800 n. Chr. von Karl dem Gro&#223;en geschaffen. Es bedeckte weite Teile Mitteleuropas von den Niederlanden bis nach Ungarn und war gleichzeitig eine politische Gro&#223;macht und ein Pulverfass politischer R&#228;nkespiele und milit&#228;rischer Konflikte. Teils nur dem Namen nach "Kaiser", konnten die Herrscher des Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches kaum echte Kontrolle &#252;ber jegliches Gebiet aus&#252;ben, das sich au&#223;erhalb der Reichweite ihrer pers&#246;nlichen Streitkr&#228;fte befand.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obwohl das Heilige R&#246;mische Reich erst in der sp&#228;teren Regierungszeit Ottos I. (962 - 973) als solches bezeichnet wurde, entstand es als politische Einheit bereits 800 n. Chr., als Papst Leo III., um die Bindung an das schw&#228;cher werdende Byzantinische Reich zu kappen, Karl den Gro&#223;en zum "R&#246;mischen Kaiser" kr&#246;nte. Karl der Gro&#223;e war ein scharfsinniger milit&#228;rischer Stratege und frommer Katholik, und es gelang ihm, das Reich bis zu seinem Tod im Jahre 814 zusammenzuhalten, w&#228;hrend es in der Folgezeit in sich bekriegende Einzelstaaten zerfiel, die erst unter der Herrschaft Ottos I. wiedervereint wurden. Obwohl es Otto I. gelang, das Reich wieder zu vereinen, sorgte seine Konzentration auf Italien ebenso wie die vieler nachfolgender Kaiser f&#252;r seinen und deren Untergang. Obwohl Italien offiziell nicht Teil des Reiches war, &#252;berfiel Otto I. das Land wiederholt, um Besitzt&#252;mer darin f&#252;r das Heilige R&#246;mische Reich zu sichern. Die meisten seiner Feldz&#252;ge nach Italien scheiterten jedoch, und Otto I. schw&#228;chte lediglich das Fundament seiner Macht in Deutschland.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Lauf der ganzen Geschichte war das Heilige R&#246;mische Reich Schauplatz f&#252;r Auseinandersetzungen zwischen seinen Kaisern und der Kirche. Anfangs konnte nur der Papst den R&#246;mischen Kaiser ernennen, jedoch mit der Zeit - vor allem w&#228;hrend der Herrschaft Ottos I. - wurde der n&#228;chste Papst stattdessen vom Kaiser bestimmt, wodurch der Thron enorme religi&#246;se Macht gewann. W&#228;hrend der Regierungszeit der Salischen Kaiser (1024 - 1125) wandelte sich diese Praxis wieder. Ein Rat aus Kirchenm&#228;nnern, die als Kardin&#228;le bekannt waren, wurde gebildet und diesem wurde die Macht &#252;bertragen, den Papst zu nominieren und zu w&#228;hlen. Diese Praxis ist mit geringf&#252;gigen Abweichungen bis heute &#252;blich.[PARAGRAPH:1] Karl IV. war vielleicht der am praktischsten veranlagte Herrscher seines Reiches. Er wurde von der Kurie im Jahr 1355 zum Kaiser des Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches gew&#228;hlt, gab sofort jeglichen kaiserlichen Anspruch auf Italien auf und konzentrierte sich stattdessen auf den Machterhalt in den deutschen Landen und der Osth&#228;lfte seines Reiches. Er akzeptierte, dass die deutschen St&#228;dte und Territorien das politische und milit&#228;rische Einflussgebiet der jeweiligen &#246;rtlichen Herrscher waren, und arbeitete mit diesen vor Ort zusammen, um eine gemeinsame Herrschaft zu errichten, anstatt zu versuchen, sie zu entmachten. Leider verfiel nach Karls Tod sein Sohn Sigismund wieder dem historischen Irrsinn, Italien kontrollieren zu wollen, und das Reich setzte seinen Weg in die Unbedeutsamkeit wieder fort.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trotz interner politischer Machtk&#228;mpfe, die das Heilige R&#246;mische Reich ersch&#252;tterten, taten sich die &#246;rtlichen Herrscher zusammen, um der Bedrohung durch Napoleon und Frankreich entgegenzutreten. Von 1792 bis 1802 vereinigten &#214;sterreich, Preu&#223;en und andere deutsche Staaten ihre Streitkr&#228;fte in der Hoffnung, die angreifenden Franzosen zu besiegen, doch ohne Erfolg. Als er nur noch wenig Gebiet beherrschte, trat Kaiser Franz II. als Kaiser des Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches zur&#252;ck. Das Reich wurde am 6. August 1806 offiziell aufgel&#246;st. [PARAGRAPH:1]Im Lauf seiner Geschichte war das Heilige R&#246;mische Reich eher als Idee, denn als Verwaltungsorganisation existent. Die Staatsoberh&#228;upter des Reiches hatten nur selten direkte Kontrolle &#252;ber ihre L&#228;ndereien, und andauernde Querelen zwischen Lehnsleuten sowie zwischen Kirche und Staat hinderten das Reich an der Konsolidierung und damit daran, echte Kontrolle &#252;ber sein Gebiet zu erringen. Seine Wiedererschaffung war jedoch das Ziel zahlreicher Eroberer, darunter Otto von Bismarck und K&#246;nig Wilhelm I.</German>
		<Italian>Il Sacro Romano Impero fu fondato nell'800 d.C. da Carlo Magno. Si estendeva su gran parte dell'Europa centrale, dai Paesi Bassi all'Ungheria ed era un calderone politico e un focolaio di intrighi e conflitti militari. Per certi versi il titolo di imperatore dei regnanti del Sacro Romano era solo formale; spesso, infatti, questi non erano in grado di esercitare alcun controllo al di fuori della portata dei loro eserciti personali.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sebbene la denominazione Sacro Romano Impero risalga al periodo del regno di Ottone I (962-973), esso si costitu&#236; come entit&#224; politica nell'800 d.C. quando papa Leone III, nel tentativo di spezzare i legami con l'Impero Bizantino ormai in declino, incoron&#242; Carlo Magno "imperatore dei Romani". Carlo Magno era un acuto stratega e un devoto cattolico e riusc&#236; a mantenere unito l'Impero fino alla propria morte, nell'814. A quel punto l'Impero cominci&#242; a dividersi in stati in guerra fra loro fino a quando non venne nuovamente riunito sotto il governo di Ottone I. Pur riuscendo a riunire l'Impero, la fissazione per l'Italia fu la rovina di Ottone I e di molti suoi successori. Nonostante l'Italia non facesse formalmente parte dell'Impero, Ottone I la invase ripetutamente cercando di conquistare nuove terre. La maggior parte delle spedizioni militari non ebbe per&#242; successo e Ottone I riusc&#236; solamente a indebolire il proprio potere in Germania.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durante tutta la propria storia, il Sacro Romano Impero fece da palcoscenico ai conflitti tra i propri Imperatori e la Chiesa. Inizialmente solo il papa poteva incoronare l'imperatore ma, col passare del tempo e specialmente durante il regno di Ottone I, la situazione si ribalt&#242; e fu l'imperatore a designare il papa successivo, dando al trono un enorme potere religioso. Durante il regno degli Imperatori Salici (1024-1125) la pratica cambi&#242; nuovamente. Fu creato un consiglio di uomini di chiesa, chiamati cardinali, e a loro fu concesso il potere di nominare ed eleggere i papi. Questa prassi &#232; continuata fino al giorno d'oggi, con cambiamenti minimi.[PARAGRAPH:1]Carlo IV regn&#242; con una visione molto pragmatica del proprio impero. Eletto dal consiglio dei cardinali nel 1355, Carlo abbandon&#242; immediatamente tutte le ambizioni imperiali in Italia e si concentr&#242; nel consolidare il proprio potere nelle terre germaniche e nella met&#224; orientale dell'impero. Accettando il fatto che le citt&#224; e i territori tedeschi fossero sotto il dominio militare e politico dei signori locali, Carlo lavor&#242; con questi per stabilire un controllo congiunto, invece di tentare di portare loro via il potere. Sfortunatamente, alla morte di Carlo il figlio Sigismondo ricadde nel tentativo, storicamente sbagliato, di conquistare l'Italia e l'impero cominci&#242; ancora una volta il proprio declino.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante le lotte di potere intestine che squassavano il Sacro Romano Impero, i governanti locali si unirono per affrontare la minaccia francese di Napoleone. Dal 1792 al 1802, Austria, Prussia e gli altri stati tedeschi unirono le proprie forze nella speranza di sconfiggere gli invasori francesi, senza alcun risultato. Francesco II, a cui rimanevano ormai ben poche terre su cui regnare, rinunci&#242; alla corona imperiale, sancendo cos&#236; la fine del Sacro Romano Impero il 6 agosto del 1806.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durante la propria storia, il Sacro Romano Impero esistette pi&#249; come idea che come effettiva organizzazione amministrativa. Gli Imperatori avevano raramente il controllo della terra e i costanti litigi tra i feudatari, oltre a quelli tra chiesa e stato, impedirono all'impero di solidificare il controllo sui propri domini. La sua ricreazione per&#242; &#232; diventata un obiettivo ricercato da molti aspiranti conquistatori nella storia, tra cui Otto von Bismark, re Guglielmo I e Adolf Hitler.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El Sacro Imperio Romano fue fundado en el a&#241;o 800 d. C. por Carlomagno. El imperio, que se extendi&#243; a lo largo de gran parte de Europa central, desde Holanda hasta Hungr&#237;a, era tanto una potencia pol&#237;tica como un semillero de intrigas y conflictos militares. Los gobernantes del Sacro Imperio Romano, "emperadores" puramente nominales en algunos aspectos, no sol&#237;an ejercer un control real sobre territorios situados m&#225;s all&#225; del alcance de sus ej&#233;rcitos personales.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aunque el Sacro Imperio Romano no recibi&#243; tal denominaci&#243;n hasta los tiempos de Ot&#243;n I (962-973), apareci&#243; como entidad pol&#237;tica en el a&#241;o 800 d. C., cuando el Papa Le&#243;n III, en su af&#225;n por romper sus v&#237;nculos con el debilitado Imperio Bizantino, coron&#243; a Carlomagno como "Emperador de los romanos". Astuto estratega y devoto cat&#243;lico, Carlomagno logr&#243; mantener su imperio unificado hasta su muerte (814), cuando se desintegr&#243; en diferentes estados que se enfrentaron en guerras seculares hasta volver a unirse bajo el mando de Ot&#243;n I. Aunque Ot&#243;n I logr&#243; reunificar el imperio, su ruina, igual que la de muchos de sus sucesores, fue su obsesi&#243;n con Italia. Aunque Italia no formaba parte del imperio, Ot&#243;n I la invadi&#243; repetidas veces con la intenci&#243;n de incorporarla a su imperio germ&#225;nico. Sin embargo, la mayor&#237;a de sus aventuras militares en tierras transalpinas se saldaron con fracasos y, al final, lo &#250;nico que Ot&#243;n I consigui&#243; fue erosionar su base de poder en la propia Alemania.[PARAGRAPH:1]A lo largo de su historia, el Sacro Imperio Romano fue escenario de numerosos conflictos entre los emperadores y la Iglesia. En un primer momento era el Papa quien pose&#237;a el derecho a nombrar al emperador, pero, con el paso del tiempo -en especial durante el reinado de Ot&#243;n I-, empezaron a ser los emperadores los que designaban a los nuevos Papas, lo que supuso un inmenso poder religioso para el trono imperial. Durante la &#233;poca de los emperadores salios (1024-1125), esta pr&#225;ctica volvi&#243; a cambiar. Se form&#243; un colegio de eclesi&#225;sticos, denominados cardenales, con el poder de nombrar y elegir a los papas. Esta pr&#225;ctica se ha mantenido, con peque&#241;as modificaciones, hasta nuestros d&#237;as.[PARAGRAPH:1]Carlos VI gobern&#243; su imperio con una visi&#243;n totalmente pragm&#225;tica. Nombrado emperador del Sacro Imperio por el colegio cardenalicio en 1355, Carlos renunci&#243; inmediatamente a todas las ambiciones imperiales en Italia y se concentr&#243; en consolidar su poder en el &#225;mbito germ&#225;nico y en las regiones orientales de su imperio. El nuevo emperador acept&#243; el principio de que las ciudades y territorios alemanes eran dominios pol&#237;ticos y militares de sus respectivos gobernantes, y trabaj&#243; con &#233;stos para establecer un condominio de poder en lugar de enfrentarse a ellos Por desgracia, a la muerte de Carlos, su hijo Segismundo volvi&#243; a sucumbir al espejismo italiano y el imperio reanud&#243; su proceso de declive.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sin embargo, a pesar de las luchas intestinas que zarandaban el Sacro Imperio Romano, los diferentes se&#241;ores que lo formaban se unieron para hacer frente a la amenaza napole&#243;nica procedente de Francia. De 1792 a 1802, Austria, Prusia y los dem&#225;s estados germ&#225;nicos combinaron sus fuerzas con la esperanza de repeler las invasiones francesas, pero fue en vano. Francisco II, con sus territorios gravemente mermados, no tuvo m&#225;s remedio que renunciar al t&#237;tulo de emperador del Sacro Imperio. El imperio se disolvi&#243; formalmente el 6 de agosto de 1806.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hist&#243;ricamente hablando, el Sacro Imperio Romano fue m&#225;s una idea que un ente administrativo real. Sus l&#237;deres no sol&#237;an ejercer aut&#233;ntico control sobre sus territorios, y los constantes enfrentamientos entre los diferentes se&#241;ores, as&#237; como entre la Iglesia y el Estado, impidieron que el imperio solidificara su autoridad. Sin embargo, la idea de su recreaci&#243;n sirvi&#243; como objetivo a muchos conquistadores y aventureros pol&#237;ticos, como Otto von Bismark, el rey Guillermo I y Adolf Hitler.</Spanish>

		<English>The Khmer Empire was a kingdom located in Southeast Asia from 790 until 1431 AD. At its height, the Khmer Empire covered fully one half of Southeast Asia, encompassing what is today Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and parts of Myanmar.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Khmer Empire was founded on the remnants of the kingdom of Chenla, which had spread itself across much of Cambodia and Laos, but had become fractured and weakened by the eighth century AD.  A former Chenla prince, Jayvaraman II, returned to the area after his education in Java and created the base of power for the Khmer Empire in the region that is today central Cambodia.[PARAGRAPH:1]The fractured state of Southeast Asia after the collapse of Chenla made the unified strength of the Khmer a welcome presence in the region. The new nation quickly annexed many of its smaller neighbors, sometimes peacefully, sometimes less so.[PARAGRAPH:1]As their prominence grew, the Khmer kings initiated many grand public works projects. King Yasovarman I, ruling from 889 to 915, built Yasodharapura, the first major capital of the Khmer, on a site that would remain important throughout Khmer history. Yasovarman also constructed the East Baray, a massive raised reservoir that was capable of holding over 60 million cubic meters of water.[PARAGRAPH:1]Not long after Yasovarman's reign, internal struggles began to sweep the Khmer Empire. And while a number of impressive works of construction were completed during this period, it was not until the reign of Jayavarman V, from 968 to 1001 that the Khmer Empire could again find itself in relative peace. And it would still be another century until Suryavarman II would again make the Khmer a force to be reckoned with.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ascending to the throne in 1113, Suryavarman II established himself as a firm ruler over the squabbling princes that wreaked havoc on the reign of his father, Suryavarman I. Wisely guiding the forces within his nation, Suryavarman the younger would turn the Khmer Empire into the most powerful kingdom in southeast Asia. Extending his domain over much of neighboring Thailand and Myanmar and constructing Angkor Wat, a monumental temple complex erected not far from the site of the original Khmer capital of Yasodharapura, Suryavarman would guide his Empire to its greatest heights.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly after the death of Suryavarman in 1150, relations would sour between the Khmer and the Champa Empire, former allies of the Khmer, and would lead to the sacking of Angkor Wat in 1177, nearly drawing to an end the reign of the Khmer kingdom. The kingdom would be given one last flourish under the reign of Jayavarman VII, whose keen military insight brought the Champa under Khmer control. A devout Buddhist, Jayavarman also littered the Cambodian countryside with new temples.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jayavarman's reign would mark the end of the powerful rulers of the Khmer. A Thai uprising established the kingdom of Ayutthaya in 1350, which would eventually absorb all that once was the Khmer Empire within its borders by 1431.</English>

Et ce n'est qu'un si&#232;cle plus tard que Suryavarman II parviendra &#224; faire des Khmers une force non n&#233;gligeable.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suryavarman II acc&#232;de au tr&#244;ne en 1113 et prend l'ascendant sur les princes qui avaient totalement d&#233;sorganis&#233; le r&#232;gne de son p&#232;re Suryavarman I. Suryavarman sait guider son peuple avec sagesse et fait de l'empire khmer le royaume le plus puissant de l'Asie du sud-est.

		<German>Das Reich der Khmer war ein von 790 bis 1431 n. Chr. bestehendes K&#246;nigreich in S&#252;dostasien. Zu seiner Bl&#252;tezeit bedeckte das Reich der Khmer die H&#228;lfte S&#252;dostasiens und umfasste das heutige Kambodscha, Laos, Thailand und Teile Myanmars.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Reich der Khmer gr&#252;ndete sich auf die &#220;berreste des K&#246;nigreichs von Chenla, das einst den Gro&#223;teil von Kambodscha und Laos bedeckt hatte, jedoch im 8. Jahrhundert n. Chr. zersplittert war. Ein ehemaliger Prinz aus Chenla, Jayavarman II., kehrte nach seiner Erziehung auf Java zur&#252;ck und schuf die Machtgrundlage f&#252;r das Reich der Khmer auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Kambodscha.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach der Zersplitterung S&#252;dostasiens, die auf den Zusammenbruch Chenlas folgte, war die vereinigte St&#228;rke der Khmer in der Region willkommen. Die neue Nation annektierte rasch viele ihrer kleineren Nachbarn, manchmal friedlich, manchmal weniger friedlich.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit wachsender Bedeutung lie&#223;en die K&#246;nige der Khmer viele gro&#223;artige &#246;ffentliche Bauwerke errichten. K&#246;nig Yasovarman I., der von 889 bis 915 herrschte, baute Yasodharapura, die erste gro&#223;e Hauptstadt der Khmer, an einer Stelle, die im ganzen Verlauf der Geschichte der Khmer bedeutend bleiben w&#252;rde. Yasovarman errichtete auch den Ost-Baray, ein gewaltiges erh&#246;htes Wasserbecken, das 60 Millionen Kubikmeter Wasser fassen konnte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kurz nach dem Ende der Herrschaft Yasovarmans begannen innere K&#228;mpfe, das Reich der Khmer zu ersch&#252;ttern. Zwar wurden in dieser Zeit eine Reihe beeindruckender Bauten fertiggestellt, doch erst unter der Herrschaft Jayavarmans V., von 968 bis 1001, erlebte das Reich der Khmer wieder relativen Frieden. Und bis Suryavarman II. die Khmer wieder zu einer nicht zu untersch&#228;tzenden Macht formen sollte, sollte noch ein weiteres Jahrhundert vergehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suryavarman II. bestieg den Thron im Jahr 1113 und etablierte sich als strenger Herrscher &#252;ber die zankenden Prinzen, die die Herrschaft seines Vaters, Suryavarmans I., ins Chaos gest&#252;rzt hatten. Suryavarman der J&#252;ngere leitete die Kr&#228;fte innerhalb seines Volkes weise an und verwandelte das Reich der Khmer in das m&#228;chtigste K&#246;nigreich S&#252;dostasiens. Suryavarman erweiterte seinen Einflussbereich &#252;ber einen Gro&#223;teil des benachbarten Thailands und Myanmars hinaus, errichtete Angkor Wat, eine monumentale Tempelanlage nicht weit vom Originalstandort der Khmer-Hauptstadt unter Yasodharapura, und f&#252;hrte so sein Reich in die Bl&#252;tezeit.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kurz nach dem Tod Suryavarmans 1150 k&#252;hlten die Beziehungen zwischen den Khmer und dem Reich der Champa, den ehemaligen Verb&#252;ndeten der Khmer, ab und Angkor Wat wurde 1177 gepl&#252;ndert und das K&#246;nigreich der Khmer beinahe vernichtet. Unter Jayavarman VII., dessen scharfer milit&#228;rischer Verstand die Champa unter Kontrolle durch die Khmer brachte, erlebte das K&#246;nigreich eine letzte Bl&#252;te. Als frommer Buddhist &#252;berzog Jayavarman die Landschaft in Kambodscha auch mit neuen Tempeln.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jayavarmans Herrschaft sollte das Ende der m&#228;chtigen Khmer-Herrscher sein. Aus einem Aufstand der Thai ging 1350 das K&#246;nigreich Ayutthaya hervor, das 1431 alles umfassen sollte, was sich einst innerhalb der Grenzen des Khmer-Reichs befand.</German>
		<Italian>L'Impero Khmer era un regno che si estese nel sudest asiatico dal 790 al 1431 d.C. Al massimo del suo splendore, l'Impero Khmer copriva interamente met&#224; del sudest asiatico, comprendendo quelli che sono gli attuali Cambogia, Laos, Tailandia e parte del Myanmar.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'Impero Khmer fu fondato sui resti del regno di Chanla, che si estendeva su gran parte di Cambogia e Laos ma che, nell'ottavo secolo d.C., si era sgretolato e indebolito. Jayvaraman II, un tempo principe Chenla, torn&#242; in zona dopo aver ricevuto la propria educazione a Giava e cre&#242; la base di potere per l'Impero Khmer nella regione che &#232; oggi il centro della Cambogia.[PARAGRAPH:1]La suddivisione del sudest asiatico dopo la caduta di Chenla rese le forze unificate dei Khmer una presenza benvenuta nella regione. La nuova nazione annesse rapidamente molte di quelle vicine, a volte in pace, altre no.[PARAGRAPH:1]Con l'aumentare della loro importanza, i re Khmer avviarono molti grandi progetti pubblici. Re Yashovarman I, che regn&#242; dall'889 al 915, costru&#236; Yasodharapura, la prima grande capitale Khmer, in una localit&#224; che rimarr&#224; importante durante tutta la storia dei Khmer. Yashovarman costru&#236; anche il Baray orientale, un gigantesco serbatoio rialzato in grado di contenere pi&#249; di 60 milioni di metri cubi d'acqua.[PARAGRAPH:1]Non molto dopo il regno di Yashovarman, si manifestarono delle lotte intestine all'Impero Khmer. Pur essendo state portate a termine molte costruzioni impressionanti in questo periodo, l'Impero Khmer dovette aspettare il regno di Jayvarman V, dal 968 al 1001, per conoscere un periodo di relativa pace. Sarebbe dovuto passare un altro secolo, prima che Suryavarman II rendesse nuovamente i Khmer una forza temibile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Salito al trono nel 1113, Suryavarman II si afferm&#242; come fermo sovrano sui litigiosi principi che devastarono il regno di suo padre, Suryavarman I. Guidando con saggezza le forze della nazione, il giovane Suryavarman trasform&#242; l'Impero Khmer nel regno pi&#249; potente del sudest asiatico. Estese il proprio dominio su gran parte dei vicini Tailandia e Myanmar e costru&#236; Angkor Vat, un tempio monumentale eretto a non molta distanza dal luogo dove era sorta l'originaria capitale Khmer, Yasodharapura; Suryavarman avrebbe portato l'Impero alle pi&#249; alte vette di splendore.[PARAGRAPH:1]Poco dopo la morte di Suryavarman, nel 1150, le relazioni tra l'Impero Khmer e quello Champa, ex alleati, si deteriorarono: la situazione sfoci&#242; nel sacco di Angkor Vat del 1177 e quasi caus&#242; la fine del regno Khmer. L'Impero si riprese un'ultima volta sotto la guida di Jayavarman VII, il cui acuto intuito militare gli permise di assumere il controllo dei Champa. Jayavarman era un devoto buddista e dissemin&#242; la campagna cambogiana di nuovi templi.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jayavarman fu l'ultimo dei potenti leader dei Khmer. Nel 1350 una rivolta Thai diede vita al regno di Ayutthaya, che attorno al 1431 assorb&#236; nei propri confini quello che era l'Impero Khmer.</Italian>

		<English>The Mayan Empire blossomed within the thick jungles and volcanic hills of Belize, Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Creators of the most advanced civilization in the Americas from 700 BC until 900 AD, the Mayan population in its age was second only to the Chinese T'ang dynasty in sheer numbers.[PARAGRAPH:1]Often referred to as the "Greeks of the New World," the Mayans were similarly organized into a series of feuding city states, although these cities served more religious and administrative purposes than as populations centers. Uniting the Maya culture was a common language, religion and artistic style, but each city state remained fiercely independent, often uniting only at the point of a Holkan spear. [PARAGRAPH:1]Every city-state was governed by its own royal family, whom often claimed full or semi-divinity. During the Mayan Classical Period from roughly 250 to 900 AD, these cities became vast complexes of pyramids, causeways and plazas. Nakbe, the first city-state to grow on a grand scale, began its expansion around 700 BC. By 300 BC, Nakbe had been transformed into an impressive city, with four grand step pyramids and a seven mile stone causeway linking it to the nearby city of El Mirador. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nakbe was only the first of many vast cities. Chichen Itza, Tikal and Palenque all became massive population centers. With myriad pyramids and religious structures, Tikal grew to become a city of the grandest scale and the largest of the Mayan population centers, dwarfing Palenque and Copan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Palenque, a significantly smaller settlement to the West, reached its zenith in the seventh century AD under the reign of Pacal II, whose subjugation of neighboring cities ensured the hegemony of his own. Much is known about Pacal and his city thanks to the intricately-carved history left to us within Pacal's tomb, "The Temple of Inscriptions," entire walls of which were filled with the Mayans' distinctive pictographic language, the only written language developed in the Americas. [PARAGRAPH:1]Language was not the only realm in which Mayan minds excelled. Their calendars were nearly on par with those of the modern era, but were created without the use of the telescope or other tools. Independent development of the number zero, an accomplishment that eluded both the Greeks and Romans, was yet another of the impressive feats of the Mayans. [PARAGRAPH:1]Most of these discoveries grew out of the Mayan religion. And while certainly interested in knowledge, the Mayan religion was ensconced in the belief of the power of blood. Many wars among the Maya were fought simply to provide prisoners to be sacrificed in intricate religious ceremonies, thought necessary to ensure the safety and advancement of the people. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Mayan civilization came to a surprisingly abrupt end, and the cause of this fall is still a hotly debated topic. One of the most widely-accepted theories is that the delicate ecology of the Yucatan rainforests simply could no longer support the growing population of the Mayan people. A peasant revolt is also a likely cause of the fall of Mayan priestly caste, as belief in brutal Mayan rituals fell to the wayside. [PARAGRAPH:1]But the popular notion that the Mayans simply disappeared is false. While the grand temple building, intricate carvings and sacrifices ceased, the Mayan language and people continued to survive in their former homeland, even after the conquest of their country by Spanish conquistadors. The Mayan languages, Yucatec being the most common, are still spoken to this day and armed resistance by the Maya continued into the twentieth century. The Maya remain a living people.</English>
		<French>L'empire maya prosp&#232;re au milieu des jungles &#233;paisses et des collines volcaniques du Belize, du Guatemala et de la p&#233;ninsule mexicaine du Yucatan. Fondateurs de la civilisation la plus avanc&#233;e des Am&#233;riques entre 700 av. J.C. et 900 ap. J.C, les Mayas forment &#224; cette &#233;poque la deuxi&#232;me plus grande population du monde, juste apr&#232;s la dynastie chinoise des T'ang.[PARAGRAPH:1]Souvent surnomm&#233;s les "grecs du nouveau monde", les Mayas sont eux aussi organis&#233;s en cit&#233;s guerri&#232;res, m&#234;me si ces cit&#233;s servent plus de centres religieux et administratifs que de centres populaires. Les Mayas sont li&#233;s par une langue, une religion et un style artistique communs, mais chaque cit&#233; demeure f&#233;rocement ind&#233;pendante, ne s'unissant souvent qu'au bout de la lance d'un holkan. [PARAGRAPH:1]Chaque cit&#233; est gouvern&#233;e par sa propre famille royale, qui se r&#233;clame souvent d'origine divine ou semi-divine. Au cours de l'&#232;re classique maya, de 250 &#224; 900 ap. J.C. environ, ces cit&#233;s deviennent de vastes complexes abritant nombre de pyramides, de chauss&#233;es et de places. Nakbe, la premi&#232;re cit&#233; &#224; conna&#238;tre un d&#233;veloppement de grande ampleur, entame son expansion aux environs de 700 av. J.C. En 300 av. J.C. Nakbe se transforme en une immense ville, pourvue de quatre grandes pyramides et d'une chauss&#233;e en pierre de onze kilom&#232;tres reliant la ville &#224; la cit&#233; voisine de El Mirador.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais d'autres villes connaissent la m&#234;me croissance. Chich&#233;n Itz&#225;, Tikal et Palenque deviennent toutes d'immenses centres urbains. Dot&#233;e d'une myriade de pyramides et de structures religieuses, Tikal devient une ville grandiose et le plus grand centre de population maya, &#233;clipsant m&#234;me Palenque et Copan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Palenque, petite colonie de l'ouest, atteint son z&#233;nith au septi&#232;me si&#232;cle avant J.C. sous le r&#232;gne de Pacal II qui, en assujettissant les cit&#233;s voisines, assure l'h&#233;g&#233;monie de la sienne. Nous savons beaucoup de choses sur Pacal et sa ville gr&#226;ce au Temple des inscriptions, dont les murs sont couverts de symboles mayas, lesquels formaient le seul langage &#233;crit d&#233;velopp&#233; dans les Am&#233;riques.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les mayas n'ont pas excell&#233; que pour le langage. Leurs calendriers &#233;taient presque aussi sophistiqu&#233;s que ceux de l'&#232;re moderne alors qu'ils ne disposaient ni du t&#233;lescope ni d'aucun autre outil. L'invention du chiffre z&#233;ro, qui avait &#233;chapp&#233; aux Grecs et aux Romains, est &#233;galement &#224; mettre sur le compte de l'ing&#233;niosit&#233; maya. [PARAGRAPH:1]La plupart de ces d&#233;couvertes trouvent leur origine dans la religion maya. M&#234;me si elle s'int&#233;resse aux nouvelles connaissances, cette derni&#232;re croit fortement au pouvoir du sang. De nombreuses guerres sont men&#233;es dans le simple but de fournir des prisonniers &#224; sacrifier lors de c&#233;r&#233;monies religieuses tr&#232;s complexes, que les Mayas consid&#232;rent n&#233;cessaires &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; et au d&#233;veloppement de leur peuple.[PARAGRAPH:1]La civilisation maya conna&#238;t une fin &#233;trangement brusque, dont la cause est encore l'objet de nombreux d&#233;bats. L'une des th&#233;ories les plus r&#233;pandues est que le fragile &#233;cosyst&#232;me des for&#234;ts du Yucatan ne pouvait plus soutenir la croissance de la population. Une r&#233;volte de paysans pourrait &#233;galement &#234;tre &#224; l'origine du d&#233;clin de la caste des pr&#234;tres, au moment m&#234;me o&#249; la croyance en leurs rites brutaux ne rassemblait plus autant d'adeptes. [PARAGRAPH:1]Mais il serait faux de penser que les Mayas ont disparu. Certes, la construction de temples et la pratique de sacrifices ont cess&#233;, mais la langue et le peuple mayas ont continu&#233; &#224; survivre, m&#234;me apr&#232;s les conqu&#234;tes des conquistadors. Les langues mayas (parmi lesquelles la plus courante est le maya yucat&#232;que) sont encore parl&#233;es de nos jours et la r&#233;sistance arm&#233;e maya se poursuivit jusqu'au vingti&#232;me si&#232;cle. Les Mayas sont toujours un peuple vivant.</French>
		<German>Das Mayareich bl&#252;hte im dichten Dschungel und auf den Vulkanh&#252;geln von Belize, Guatemala und der mexikanischen Halbinsel Yucatan. Die Maya waren von 700 v. Chr. bis 900 n. Chr. die Sch&#246;pfer der fortschrittlichsten Zivilisation auf dem amerikanischen Kontinent, und w&#228;hrend ihrer Bl&#252;tezeit stand die Bev&#246;lkerung zahlenm&#228;&#223;ig nur der der chinesischen T'ang-Dynastie nach.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Maya werden oft die "Griechen der Neuen Welt" genannt, da sie auf &#228;hnliche Weise in verschiedene einander bekriegende St&#228;dte organisiert waren, obwohl diese St&#228;dte mehr als religi&#246;se und verwaltungstechnische denn als Bev&#246;lkerungszentren dienten. Eine gemeinsame Sprache, Religion und Kunstrichtung einte die Mayakultur, doch jeder Stadtstaat legte gro&#223;en Wert auf Unabh&#228;ngigkeit, und oft konnte nur die Spitze eines Holkan-Speers ein B&#252;ndnis erzwingen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jeder Stadtstaat wurde von einer eigenen K&#246;nigsfamilie regiert, deren Mitglieder oft f&#252;r sich beanspruchten, G&#246;tter oder Halbg&#246;tter zu sein. W&#228;hrend der klassischen Epoche der Maya, von etwa 250 bis 900 n. Chr., entwickelten sich diese St&#228;dte zu gewaltigen Komplexen mit Pyramiden, Stra&#223;en und Pl&#228;tzen. Nakbe, der erste gro&#223;e Stadtstaat, begann etwa 700 v. Chr. zu expandieren. 300 v. Chr. war aus Nakbe eine beeindruckende Stadt mit vier gro&#223;en Stufenpyramiden und einer sieben Meilen langen Stra&#223;e geworden, die sie mit der Nachbarstadt El Mirador verband.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nakbe war nur die erste vieler gro&#223;er St&#228;dte. Chichen Itza, Tikal und Palenque entwickelten sich alle zu gro&#223;en Bev&#246;lkerungszentren. Tikal mit seinen Myriaden an Pyramiden und religi&#246;sen Geb&#228;uden entwickelte sich zu einer wahren Gro&#223;stadt und wurde das gr&#246;&#223;te Bev&#246;lkerungszentrum der Maya, demgegen&#252;ber Palenque und Copan geradezu klein wirkten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Palenque, eine wesentlich kleinere Siedlung im Westen, erreichte ihre Bl&#252;tezeit im 7. Jahrhundert n. Chr. unter der Herrschaft Pacals II., der die Nachbarst&#228;dte unterjochte, um seine eigene Vorherrschaft zu sichern. Dank der in Pacals Grabmal &#252;berlieferten Geschichte wissen wir viel &#252;ber Pacal und seine Stadt. Im "Tempel der Inschriften" waren ganze W&#228;nde mit der typischen Bilderschrift der Maya bedeckt, der einzigen Schriftsprache, die sich auf dem amerikanischen Kontinent entwickelt hat.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Sprachwissenschaft war nicht der einzige Bereich, in dem die Maya hervorragende Leistungen brachten. Ihre Kalender waren nicht nur denen der heutigen Zeit ebenb&#252;rtig, sondern wurden ohne die Hilfe von Teleskopen oder anderen Hilfsmitteln geschaffen. Die unabh&#228;ngige Entwicklung der Zahl Null, eine Leistung, die sowohl die Griechen wie auch die R&#246;mer verfehlten, war eine weitere beeindruckende Errungenschaft der Maya.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die meisten dieser Entdeckungen entwickelten sich aus der Religion der Maya. Und obwohl sie sicherlich an Wissen interessiert waren, war die Religion der Maya durchdrungen vom Glauben an die Macht des Blutes. Viele Kriege der Maya wurden einfach gef&#252;hrt, um Gefangene zu machen, die in ausgekl&#252;gelten religi&#246;sen Zeremonien geopfert wurden, von denen man glaubte, sie w&#228;ren f&#252;r die Sicherheit und den Fortschritt der Bev&#246;lkerung notwendig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Zivilisation der Maya erfuhr ein pl&#246;tzliches Ende, und der Grund f&#252;r diesen Untergang ist immer noch stark umstritten. Eine der anerkanntesten Theorien besagt, dass die empfindliche &#214;kologie der Regenw&#228;lder in Yucatan die wachsende Bev&#246;lkerung der Maya nicht l&#228;nger ern&#228;hren konnte. Auch gilt ein Bauernaufstand als wahrscheinliche Ursache f&#252;r den Fall der Priesterkaste der Maya, als der Glaube an die brutalen Mayarituale an Kraft verlor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Doch die volkst&#252;mliche Anschauung, die Maya w&#228;ren einfach verschwunden, ist falsch. Obgleich die gro&#223;artigen Tempelanlagen, feinen Steinmetzarbeiten und die Opferzeremonien nicht mehr existieren, haben die Sprache und das Volk der Maya in ihrer ehemaligen Heimat &#252;berlebt und sogar die Eroberung ihres Landes durch die spanischen Konquistadoren &#252;berstanden. Die Sprachen der Maya, deren h&#228;ufigste Yucatec ist, werden noch heute gesprochen, und der bewaffnete Widerstand der Maya dauerte bis in das 20. Jahrhundert an. Die Maya bleiben eine lebendige Kultur.</German>
		<Italian>L'Impero Maya fior&#236; nelle fitte giungle e sulle colline vulcaniche di Belize, Guatemala e sulla penisola dello Yucatan in Messico. La popolazione maya rappresent&#242; la civilt&#224; pi&#249; avanzata in America dal 700 a.C. fino al 900 d.C. e, a suo tempo, fu inferiore come numero solo a quella cinese della dinastia T'ang.[PARAGRAPH:1]Spesso definiti i "Greci del Nuovo Mondo", i Maya erano analogamente organizzati in una serie di citt&#224;-stato in lotta tra loro, anche se tali citt&#224; avevano scopi pi&#249; religiosi e amministrativi che non fungere da centri della popolazione. A unire la cultura maya erano linguaggio, religione e stile artistico comuni, ma ogni citt&#224;-stato rimaneva fieramente indipendente, spesso unita solo grazie alla punta della lancia di un Holkan. [PARAGRAPH:1]Ogni citt&#224;-stato era governata dalla propria famiglia reale, che spesso rivendicava una divinit&#224; parziale o totale. Durante il periodo classico maya, all'incirca dal 250 al 900 d.C., queste citt&#224; divennero vasti complessi di piramidi, sentieri rialzati e piazze. Nakbe fu la prima citt&#224;-stato a crescere molto e cominci&#242; la propria espansione attorno al 700 a.C. Nel 300 a.C. Nakbe si era trasformata in una citt&#224; impressionante, con quattro piramidi a gradoni e un sentiero in pietra di quasi dodici chilometri che la collegava alla vicina citt&#224; di El Mirador. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nakbe fu solo la prima di molte citt&#224; immense. Chichen Itza, Tikal e Palenque divennero tutte grossi centri urbani. Con miriadi di piramidi e strutture religiose, Tikal crebbe fino a diventare la citt&#224; pi&#249; importante e il maggiore fra i centri popolati dei Maya, ancor pi&#249; di Palenque e Copan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Palenque, un insediamento decisamente pi&#249; piccolo a ovest, raggiunse il massimo splendore nel settimo secolo d.C. sotto il regno di Pakal II, che sottomise le citt&#224; circostanti assicurando l'egemonia della propria. Molto si sa di Pakal e della sua citt&#224; grazie alla storia incisa all'interno della sua tomba, il "Tempio delle Iscrizioni". Al suo interno, interi muri erano ricoperti con la caratteristica scrittura pittografica dei Maya, l'unico linguaggio scritto mai sviluppato in America. [PARAGRAPH:1]Il linguaggio non era l'unico campo in cui le menti dei Maya eccellevano. I loro calendari sono quasi al livello di quelli odierni ma furono creati senza l'uso di telescopi o altri strumenti. La scoperta indipendente del numero zero, cosa che sfugg&#236; a Greci e Romani, &#232; un'altra delle impressionanti imprese dei Maya. [PARAGRAPH:1]La maggior parte di queste scoperte &#232; da imputare alla religione Maya. Pur essendo interessati alla conoscenza, la loro religione era basata sulla fede nel potere del sangue. Molte guerre tra i Maya furono combattute semplicemente con lo scopo di ottenere prigionieri da sacrificare in complesse cerimonie religiose, che si pensava fossero necessarie per assicurare la salvezza e il progresso. [PARAGRAPH:1]La civilt&#224; Maya ebbe una fine brusca e prematura e il motivo &#232; ancora fonte di dibattito. Una delle teorie pi&#249; diffuse &#232; che la delicata ecologia delle foreste dello Yucatan non riusc&#236; pi&#249; a sopportare la popolazione in aumento della civilt&#224; maya. Anche la rivolta dei contadini potrebbe essere una causa verosimile della caduta della casta dei preti maya, per via di una diminuzione della fede nei brutali rituali maya. [PARAGRAPH:1]Ma la diffusa credenza che il popolo maya sia veramente scomparso &#232; falsa. Gli enormi templi, i complessi geroglifici e i sacrifici sono terminati, ma la lingua e il popolo maya continuano a sopravvivere nella loro vecchia patria, anche dopo la conquista del loro Paese da parte dei conquistatori spagnoli. Lo Yucatec &#232; il pi&#249; diffuso tra gli idiomi maya, molti dei quali sono parlati ancora oggi, e la resistenza armata dei Maya &#232; continuata fino al ventesimo secolo. I Maya rimangono un popolo vivo.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El imperio maya floreci&#243; en las densas selvas y las colinas volc&#225;nicas de Belice, Guatemala y la pen&#237;nsula del Yucat&#225;n, en M&#233;xico. Creadores de la m&#225;s avanzada civilizaci&#243;n americana desde el 700 a. C. al 900 d. C., los mayas de aquel tiempo solo eran superados en n&#250;mero por la dinast&#237;a china de los T'ang.[PARAGRAPH:1]Los mayas, descritos en numerosas ocasiones como los "griegos del nuevo mundo" estaban organizados, al igual que &#233;stos, en una serie de ciudades-estado rivales. No obstante, en este caso, el t&#233;rmino "ciudad" hace m&#225;s referencia a un centro administrativo y religioso que a una unidad poblacional. Los elementos que unificaban la cultura maya eran una lengua, una religi&#243;n y un estilo art&#237;stico comunes, pero cada ciudad-estado defend&#237;a celosamente su independencia y normalmente solo se un&#237;an por la fuerza. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cada ciudad-estado contaba con su propia familia real, que a menudo se atribu&#237;a una condici&#243;n divina o semidivina. Durante el per&#237;odo maya cl&#225;sico (250-900 d. C. aproximadamente), estas ciudades se convirtieron en vastos complejos de pir&#225;mides, avenidas y plazas. Nakbe, la primera ciudad-estado que alcanz&#243; unas dimensiones importantes, inici&#243; su expansi&#243;n alrededor del a&#241;o 700 a. C. Hacia el a&#241;o 300 a. C., Nakbe se hab&#237;a transformado en una impresionante metr&#243;polis, con cuatro grandes pir&#225;mides escalonadas y una avenida de m&#225;s de diez kil&#243;metros de longitud para comunicarse con la cercana ciudad de El Mirador. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nakbe fue solo la primera de numerosas metr&#243;polis. Chichen Itz&#225;, Tikal y Palenque llegaron a ser enormes centros poblacionales. Con una mir&#237;ada de pir&#225;mides y templos, Tikal se convirti&#243; en una ciudad colosal, el mayor de los centros urbanos mayas, capaz de empeque&#241;ecer incluso a Palenque y a Copan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Palenque, un asentamiento occidental considerablemente m&#225;s modesto, alcanz&#243; su c&#250;spide en el siglo VII d. C., bajo el reinado de Pacal II, que asegur&#243; la hegemon&#237;a de su ciudad sometiendo a las vecinas. Sabemos muchas cosas sobre Pacal y su ciudad gracias a la intrincada historia tallada que decora el interior de su tumba, conocida como "El templo de las Inscripciones". Hay en esta estructura paredes enteras grabadas con la caracter&#237;stica lengua pictogr&#225;fica de los mayas, el &#250;nico idioma escrito desarrollado en Am&#233;rica. [PARAGRAPH:1]El ling&#252;&#237;stico no fue el &#250;nico campo en el que descollaron los mayas. Sus calendarios eran realmente comparables con los de la era moderna, solo que estaban elaborados sin el uso de telescopios u otras herramientas. La invenci&#243;n del n&#250;mero cero, un logro matem&#225;tico que se les hab&#237;a resistido tanto a los griegos como a los romanos, fue otra proeza de los mayas. [PARAGRAPH:1]La mayor&#237;a de estos descubrimientos surgieron de la religi&#243;n maya. Esta religi&#243;n, aunque interesada en el conocimiento, se caracterizaba sobre todo por su fe en el poder de la sangre. Muchas de las guerras de los mayas se libraron con el solo objetivo de obtener prisioneros para sacrificar en sus complejas ceremonias religiosas, consideradas necesarias para garantizar la seguridad y el progreso del pueblo. [PARAGRAPH:1]La civilizaci&#243;n maya sufri&#243; un fin sorprendentemente repentino, cuya causa es a&#250;n hoy objeto de acalorados debates. Una de las teor&#237;as que concita m&#225;s unanimidad es la que cree que la delicada ecolog&#237;a de las selvas del Yucat&#225;n no pudo sustentar la creciente poblaci&#243;n de los pueblos mayas. Tambi&#233;n es probable que se produjera una revuelta popular para derribar la casta sacerdotal, provocada por el declive de la fe en sus sanguinarios rituales. [PARAGRAPH:1]Pero la idea, bastante extendida, de que los mayas desaparecieron sin m&#225;s es sencillamente falsa. Aunque la construcci&#243;n de grandes templos, la pr&#225;ctica de las tallas y los sacrificios rituales desaparecieran, la lengua y el pueblo maya continuaron viviendo en sus tierras aun despu&#233;s de la llegada de los conquistadores espa&#241;oles. Las lenguas mayas, de las cuales la m&#225;s extendida era el yucateca, siguen habl&#225;ndose en nuestros d&#237;as, y la resistencia armada de los abor&#237;genes mayas se prolong&#243; hasta el siglo XX. El pueblo maya, en suma, sigue existiendo.</Spanish>

		<English>The Native Americans were the original inhabitants of North America, emigrating roughly 16,000 years ago. The term "Native American" most often refers to the people who settled in the northern continent of the Western Hemisphere, in the land that is today owned by the United States and Canada. At the time of the arrival of Columbus, thousands of Native American tribes populated the furthest reaches of North America, with somewhere between two and 18 million Natives living in this region. (The "Native American" civilization in the game represents the empire that would have formed had these disparate people ever united.)[PARAGRAPH:1]The northern Native Americans never developed a system of writing (the Mayans to the south were the only Native Americans to do so), so the history of the Native Americans before the arrival of the Europeans is difficult to piece together. It is known, however, that these original inhabitants had crossed a land bridge (since gone) connecting Siberia with Alaska. As these Siberian immigrants spread south and east across the continent in search of sustenance, they encountered many different climates, ecologies, and geographies. Settling from within a stone's throw of the Arctic Circle to the most desolate regions of the American Southwest, the Native Americans were a testament to human adaptability. [PARAGRAPH:1]Given the diversity of lands which they inhabited, not to mention the vast distances separating them, the Native Americans never formed a unified nation. Powerful local entities - such as the Six Nations (also known as the "Iroquois Confederacy") - would appear periodically, but for the most part tribes remained the largest political organization. [PARAGRAPH:1]With the arrival of the Europeans in the New World, the Native American tribes would be forced to adapt to yet another hostile environment. As the United States established itself as a nation, the Native Americans were perceived as a roadblock to American supremacy - a roadblock which needed to be removed. Andrew Jackson, before his election as the seventh President of the United States, waged total war against the Seminoles in Florida and obliterated the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. As President, he signed into effect the "Indian Removal Act" of 1830, the precedent to numerous future "relocation treaties." The Treaty of New Echota, one such relocation treaty, was signed between the United States government and a tiny fraction of the Cherokee people. The march of the Cherokee from their homeland in the eastern United States to new territory in Oklahoma and Arkansas cost the lives of some four thousand natives, and would later become known as the "Trail of Tears." [PARAGRAPH:1]The continual pushes westwards by American settlers further displaced the Natives, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the "Indian Wars." However, the Native Americans were never able to unify on a grand enough scale to stop the Europeans or their descendents. A common scenario began to occur. Various individual tribes would fight tooth and nail against the invaders and be nearly defeated. These tribes would then be enticed into signing treaties that would often be ignored by the Americans and the tribe would once again be pushed on at the point of a bayonet. The state of Oklahoma was originally given to Native Americans who had been forced from the east, but then in the 1890s, was opened in chunks for American settlement. [PARAGRAPH:1]By the beginning of the twentieth century, between 75 and 95 percent of the Native American population had been destroyed by starvation, disease or warfare. The reservation system had consigned most survivors to usually undesirable land throughout the United States, and over the next several decades, the rates of alcoholism and suicide among the Native American population skyrocketed. But during the 1960's, a revival of Native American heritage began to emerge. Today, over two million Native Americans live in roughly 563 tribes across the United States. Native American artists such as author Sherman Alexie have beautifully conveyed the travails endured by modern Native Americans in poetry and prose, and proud peoples once forced onto reservations have again begun to spread throughout the United States.</English>

Lorsque Christophe Colomb arrive sur le territoire, des milliers de tribus am&#233;rindiennes peuplent les lointaines &#233;tendues de l'Am&#233;rique du Nord et environ 2 &#224; 18 millions d'Am&#233;rindiens vivent dans cette r&#233;gion (Dans ce jeu, la civilisation "am&#233;rindienne" repr&#233;sente l'empire qui se serait form&#233; si ces tribus disparates s'&#233;taient unies).[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Am&#233;rindiens n'ayant jamais d&#233;velopp&#233; de syst&#232;me d'&#233;criture (les Mayas au sud furent le seul peuple originaire d'Am&#233;rique &#224; le faire), l'histoire des Am&#233;rindiens est difficile &#224; reconstituer. On sait toutefois que les premiers habitants avaient travers&#233; un bras de terre (disparu depuis) qui reliait la Sib&#233;rie &#224; l'Alaska. Alors que ces immigrants sib&#233;riens se propagent au sud et &#224; l'est en qu&#234;te de nourriture, ils traversent des zones aux climats diff&#233;rents et &#224; la faune vari&#233;e. Se d&#233;ployant entre les terres jouxtant le cercle polaire et les r&#233;gions les plus arides du sud-ouest am&#233;ricain, les Am&#233;rindiens sont un excellent exemple de l'adaptabilit&#233; humaine. [PARAGRAPH:1]En raison de la diversit&#233; des terres qu'ils habitent, sans parler des vastes distances qui les s&#233;parent, les Am&#233;rindiens ne formeront jamais une nation unie. Certaines entit&#233;s politiques locales - comme les Six nations ou "Conf&#233;d&#233;ration iroquoise" - apparaissent p&#233;riodiquement mais dans l'ensemble, la plus grande organisation politique reste la tribu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Avec l'arriv&#233;e des Europ&#233;ens dans le nouveau monde, les tribus am&#233;rindiennes vont &#234;tre oblig&#233;es de s'adapter &#224; un nouvel environnement hostile. Alors que les Etats-Unis s'&#233;tablissent en tant que nation, les Am&#233;rindiens sont per&#231;us comme un obstacle &#224; la supr&#233;matie am&#233;ricaine - obstacle qu'il fallait supprimer. Avant d'&#234;tre &#233;lu septi&#232;me pr&#233;sident des Etats-Unis, Andrew Jackson m&#232;ne la guerre contre les S&#233;minoles en Floride et an&#233;antit les indiens Creek lors de la bataille de Horseshoe Bend. En sa qualit&#233; de pr&#233;sident, il signe l'"Indian Removal Act" de 1830, le premier trait&#233; de d&#233;portation. Le trait&#233; de New Echota est sign&#233; entre le gouvernement des Etats-Unis et une minuscule partie du peuple cherokee. La marche des Cherokee, qui les conduit alors de leurs terres de l'Est &#224; leurs nouveaux territoires de l'Oklahoma et de l'Arkansas, co&#251;te la vie de quelques quatre mille indiens et sera plus tard surnomm&#233;e la "Piste des Larmes."[PARAGRAPH:1]La pouss&#233;e vers l'ouest des colons am&#233;ricains provoque la d&#233;portation de nombreux indiens et se solde par une s&#233;rie de conflits connus sous le nom de "guerres indiennes." Cependant, les Am&#233;rindiens ne furent jamais capables de s'unir sur une &#233;chelle assez grande pour stopper les europ&#233;ens ou leurs descendants. Un sc&#233;nario commun commence &#224; &#233;merger. Lorsqu'une tribu est sur le point d'&#234;tre vaincue, les Am&#233;ricains la poussent &#224; signer un trait&#233; qu'ils violent aussit&#244;t, et la tribu est &#224; nouveau d&#233;port&#233;e &#224; la pointe des ba&#239;onnettes. L'Etat de l'Oklahoma est d'abord conc&#233;d&#233; aux Am&#233;rindiens forc&#233;s de quitter l'est mais dans les ann&#233;es 1890, il est ouvert &#224; la colonisation am&#233;ricaine.[PARAGRAPH:1]Au d&#233;but du vingti&#232;me si&#232;cle, entre 75 et 95 pour cent de la population am&#233;rindienne a &#233;t&#233; an&#233;antie par la famine, la maladie ou la guerre. Le syst&#232;me de r&#233;serves a consign&#233; la plupart des survivants sur des terres g&#233;n&#233;ralement ind&#233;sirables et au cours des d&#233;cennies suivantes, le taux d'alcoolisme et de suicide parmi la population am&#233;rindienne monte en fl&#232;che. Mais pendant les ann&#233;es 1960, un renouveau de la culture am&#233;rindienne commence &#224; &#233;merger. Aujourd'hui, plus de deux millions d'Am&#233;rindiens vivent dans approximativement 563 tribus &#224; travers les Etats-Unis. Certains artistes am&#233;rindiens, comme l'auteur Sherman Alexie, ont magnifiquement relat&#233; en po&#233;sie et en prose les &#233;preuves subies par les Am&#233;rindiens modernes, et les fiers peuples jadis parqu&#233;s dans des r&#233;serves recommencent &#224; vivre partout aux Etats-Unis.</French>
		<German>Die Indianer waren die Ureinwohner Nordamerikas, die vor etwa 16.000 Jahren einwanderten. Der Begriff "Indianer" bezieht sich meistens auf die Bev&#246;lkerung, die im n&#246;rdlichen Kontinent der westlichen Halbkugel siedelte, in dem Land, das heute den Vereinigten Staaten und Kanada geh&#246;rt. Zu Zeiten der Ankunft von Kolumbus bev&#246;lkerten tausende Indianerst&#228;mme auch die entlegensten Gegenden Nordamerikas, mit einer Gesamtbev&#246;lkerung von zwischen zwei und 18 Millionen Indianern. (Die "indianische" Zivilisation in diesem Spiel repr&#228;sentiert das Reich, das entstanden w&#228;re, h&#228;tte diese verstreut lebende Bev&#246;lkerung sich vereint.)[PARAGRAPH:1]Die n&#246;rdlichen Indianer entwickelten niemals ein System der Schrift (die einzigen Indianer, die das taten, waren die Maya im S&#252;den), daher ist es schwierig, die Geschichte der Indianer vor der Ankunft der Europ&#228;er zu rekonstruieren. Man wei&#223; jedoch, dass diese Ureinwohner eine (seither verschwundene) Landbr&#252;cke &#252;berquerten, die Sibirien und Alaska verband. Als diese sibirischen Einwanderer sich auf der Suche nach Nahrung nach S&#252;den und Osten &#252;ber den Kontinent ausbreiteten, trafen sie auf viele verschiedene Klimazonen, &#246;kologische Zonen und geografische Besonderheiten. Die Indianer siedelten einen Steinwurf entfernt vom Polarkreis ebenso wie in den entlegensten Regionen des amerikanischen S&#252;dwestens und legten so Zeugnis von der Anpassungsf&#228;higkeit des Menschen ab.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aufgrund der Verschiedenheit der von ihnen bewohnten Lande, ganz zu schweigen von den gewaltigen Entfernungen, die sie trennten, bildeten die Indianer niemals ein einziges Volk. M&#228;chtige &#246;rtliche Verb&#228;nde - etwa die Sechs Nationen (auch bekannt als "Irokesenbund") - tauchten von Zeit zu Zeit auf, doch gr&#246;&#223;tenteils bildeten St&#228;mme die gr&#246;&#223;te politische Organisationsform.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit der Ankunft der Europ&#228;er in der Neuen Welt waren die Indianerst&#228;mme gezwungen, sich an eine weitere feindliche Umgebung anzupassen. Als die Vereinigten Staaten sich als Nation konsolidierten, wurden die amerikanischen Ureinwohner als Hindernis auf dem Weg zur amerikanischen Vorherrschaft angesehen - ein Hindernis, das beseitigt werden musste. Vor seiner Wahl zum siebten Pr&#228;sidenten der Vereinigten Staaten f&#252;hrte Andrew Jackson einen totalen Krieg gegen die Seminolen in Florida und l&#246;schte die Creek in der Schlacht vom Horseshoe Bend aus. Als Pr&#228;sident unterzeichnete er den "Indian Removal Act" 1830, den ersten von vielen zuk&#252;nftigen "Umsiedlungsvertr&#228;gen". Der Vertrag von New Echota, ein solcher Umsiedlungsvertrag, wurde zwischen der Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten und einem kleinen Teil der Cherokee geschlossen. Der Marsch der Cherokee von ihrem Heimatland im Osten der USA in das neue Gebiet in Oklahoma und Arkansas kostete etwa viertausend Indianer das Leben und wurde sp&#228;ter als der "Marsch der Tr&#228;nen" bekannt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das st&#228;ndige Westw&#228;rtsdr&#228;ngen amerikanischer Siedler vertrieb die Ureinwohner weiter und f&#252;hrte zu einer Reihe von Konflikten, die als "Indianerkriege" bekannt sind. Die Indianer waren jedoch niemals im Stande, sich in ausreichendem Ma&#223;e zu vereinen, um die Europ&#228;er oder deren Nachfahren aufzuhalten. Es ereignete sich allm&#228;hlich immer wieder dasselbe Szenario. Verschiedene einzelne St&#228;mme k&#228;mpften mit Z&#228;hnen und Klauen gegen die Eindringlinge und wurden so fast vernichtet. Diese St&#228;mme wurden dann dazu verleitet, Vertr&#228;ge zu unterzeichnen, die von den Amerikanern oftmals ignoriert wurden, und der Stamm wurde wiederum mit dem Bajonett vertrieben. Der Staat Oklahoma war urspr&#252;nglich Indianern vermacht worden, die aus dem Osten vertrieben worden waren, doch in den 1890ern wurde er blockweise f&#252;r amerikanische Siedler ge&#246;ffnet. [PARAGRAPH:1]Zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts waren zwischen 75 und 95 Prozent der amerikanischen Ureinwohner durch Hunger, Krankheit und Krieg vernichtet. Das Reservatsystem hatte die meisten &#220;berlebenden auf &#252;blicherweise wenig begehrenswertes Land &#252;berall in den Vereinigten Staaten verbannt, und im Laufe der folgenden Jahrzehnte schoss die Alkoholiker- und Selbstmordrate unter Indianern in die H&#246;he. W&#228;hrend der 1960er Jahre begann jedoch eine Wiederbelebung des indianischen Erbes. Heute leben mehr als zwei Millionen Indianer in ungef&#228;hr 563 St&#228;mmen &#252;berall in den Vereinigten Staaten. Indianische K&#252;nstler, wie etwa der Autor Sherman Alexie, haben in Dichtung und Prosa wundervoll die Qualen festgehalten, die moderne Indianer ertragen mussten, und stolze V&#246;lker, die einst in Reservaten eingesperrt waren, haben erneut begonnen, sich &#252;berall in den Vereinigten Staaten auszubreiten.</German>
		<Italian>I Nativi americani erano gli abitanti originali del Nord America, emigrati circa 16.000 anni fa. Il termine "nativi americani" si usa principalmente per le popolazioni che si insediarono nel continente settentrionale dell'emisfero occidentale, sulla terra al giorno d'oggi occupata da Stati Uniti e Canada. All'arrivo di Colombo migliaia di trib&#249; popolavano il Nord America, per un totale compreso tra i 2 e i 18 milioni di persone. (L'Impero dei Nativi Americani nel gioco rappresenta ci&#242; che si sarebbe formato se i diversi popoli si fossero uniti).[PARAGRAPH:1]I Nativi americani settentrionali non svilupparono mai un sistema di scrittura (i Maya, a sud, furono gli unici Nativi americani a fare una cosa simile) e quindi &#232; difficile ricomporre la loro storia prima dell'arrivo degli Europei. Si sa, comunque, che avevano attraversato un ponte di terra (ormai scomparso) che collegava Siberia e Alaska. Questi immigranti siberiani si spostarono a sud ed est nel continente in cerca di sostentamento, trovarono grandi diversit&#224; climatiche, ecologiche e geografiche. Si insediarono dal Circolo polare artico fino alle regioni pi&#249; desolate del sud-est americano e furono una testimonianza dell'adattabilit&#224; degli esseri umani. [PARAGRAPH:1]Data la diversit&#224; di terre che abitavano, senza parlare delle grandi distanze che li separavano, i Nativi americani non formarono mai una nazione unita. Di quando in quando apparivano potenti entit&#224; locali, come le Sei Nazioni (conosciute anche come la Confederazione degli Irochesi), ma in genere le trib&#249; rimasero la maggiore forma di organizzazione politica. [PARAGRAPH:1]Con l'arrivo degli Europei nel Nuovo Mondo, le trib&#249; di Nativi americani dovettero adattarsi ancora una volta a un ambiente ostile. Mentre gli Stati Uniti si stabilivano come nazione, i Nativi americani erano visti come un ostacolo alla supremazia americana, un ostacolo che andava rimosso. Andrew Jackson, prima di essere eletto come settimo presidente degli Stati Uniti, dichiar&#242; guerra integrale contro i Seminole in Florida e annient&#242; gli indiani Creek nella battaglia di Horseshoe Bend. Come presidente firm&#242; l'"Indian Removal Act" del 1830, il primo di numerosi trattati di deportazione o rilocazione. Uno di questi, il Trattato di New Echota, fu stipulato tra il Governo degli Stati Uniti e una piccola parte del popolo Cherokee. La marcia dei Cherokee dalla loro patria, negli Stati Uniti orientali, ai nuovi territori in Oklahoma e Arkansas cost&#242; la vita a circa quattromila indiani e divenne noto pi&#249; tardi come "Il sentiero delle lacrime". [PARAGRAPH:1]Il continuo movimento verso ovest dei coloni americani caus&#242; ulteriori spostamenti dei Nativi, risultando in una serie di conflitti conosciuti come le "Guerre indiane". I Nativi americani non furono per&#242; mai in grado di unirsi in una scala tale da fermare gli Europei o i loro discendenti. Cominci&#242; a ripetersi lo stesso scenario: diverse singole trib&#249; combattevano contro gli invasori fino alla quasi totale estinzione. Queste trib&#249; venivano poi convinte a firmare trattati che sarebbero poi stati ignorati dagli americani e le stesse trib&#249; venivano poi cacciate con le armi. Lo stato dell'Oklahoma fu inizialmente assegnato ai Nativi americani che erano stati cacciati dall'est ma poi, intorno al 1890, fu frazionato e assegnato ai coloni. [PARAGRAPH:1]All'inizio del ventesimo secolo, tra il 75 e il 95 percento della popolazione nativa americana era stata distrutta dalla fame, dalle malattie o dalla guerra. Il sistema di riserve aveva confinato la maggior parte dei sopravvissuti su terre solitamente indesiderabili attraverso tutti gli Stati Uniti e, durante i decenni successivi, salirono alle stelle i casi di alcolismo e suicidio tra i Nativi americani. Ma intorno al 1960 emerse un revival della cultura nativa americana. Oggi pi&#249; di due milioni di Nativi americani vivono in circa 563 trib&#249; in tutti gli Stati Uniti. Artisti nativi americani come l'autore Sherman Alexie sono stati in grado di trasmettere molto bene le sofferenze dei Nativi americani moderni tramite poesia e prosa e le orgogliose popolazioni costrette all'interno delle riserve hanno cominciato ancora una volta a diffondersi in tutti gli Stati Uniti.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Los indios americanos son los habitantes originales de Norteam&#233;rica, a la que llegaron hace aproximadamente 16.000 a&#241;os. El t&#233;rmino "indios americanos" hace referencia normalmente a los pueblos que se establecieron en el continente norte del hemisferio occidental, en las tierras que en la actualidad forman los Estados Unidos y Canad&#225;. A la llegada de Col&#243;n, Norteam&#233;rica estaba poblada por miles de tribus indias, con una poblaci&#243;n total de unos 18 millones de individuos. En el juego, la civilizaci&#243;n de los "indios americanos" representa el imperio que habr&#237;an formado todos estos pueblos de haber llegado a unirse alguna vez.[PARAGRAPH:1]Los indios de Norteam&#233;rica no desarrollaron nunca un sistema de escritura (de hecho, en toda Am&#233;rica, solo los mayas llegaron a hacerlo), as&#237; que la historia de estos pueblos antes de la llegada de los europeos es dif&#237;cil de reconstruir. Sin embargo, s&#237; sabemos que hab&#237;an llegado al continente atravesando el puente continental (desaparecido despu&#233;s)que conectaba Siberia con Alaska. En su avance hacia el sur y el este en busca de sustento, estos inmigrantes se encontraron con muchos climas, ecolog&#237;as y geograf&#237;as diferentes. Su establecimiento en todas las regiones que se extienden desde las proximidades del C&#237;rculo Polar &#193;rtico a las zonas m&#225;s desoladas del sudoeste americano, es la prueba m&#225;s evidente de la capacidad de adaptaci&#243;n del ser humano. [PARAGRAPH:1]La diversidad de tierras en las que habitaban, unida a las vastas distancias que los separaban, impidieron que formaran una naci&#243;n unificada. Cada cierto tiempo aparec&#237;an poderosas entidades regionales, como por ejemplo las Seis Naciones (conocidas tambi&#233;n como "Confederaci&#243;n iroquesa"), pero la mayor parte del tiempo, la tribu era la unidad organizativa m&#225;s importante. [PARAGRAPH:1]Con la llegada de los europeos al Nuevo Mundo, los indios americanos se ver&#237;an forzados a adaptarse a un entorno a&#250;n m&#225;s hostil. Tras la fundaci&#243;n de los Estados Unidos como naci&#243;n independiente, sus gobernantes empezaron a percibir a los indios como un escollo en el camino a la supremac&#237;a, un escollo que hab&#237;a que eliminar. Antes de ser elegido como s&#233;ptimo presidente de los Estados Unidos, Andrew Jackson desencaden&#243; una guerra total contra los sem&#237;nolas de Florida y aniquil&#243; a los indios creek en la batalla de Horseshoe Bend. Una vez elegido presidente, promulg&#243; la "Indian Removal Act" (1830), precedente de numerosos "tratados de traslado". Uno de ellos fue el tratado de New Echota, suscrito entre el gobierno de los Estados Unidos y una diminuta fracci&#243;n del pueblo cherokee. La marcha de los cherokees desde su tierra natal en el este de los Estados Unidos a sus nuevos territorios en Oklahoma y Arkansas, que cost&#243; cuatro mil vidas, se conocer&#237;a m&#225;s tarde como "el camino de las l&#225;grimas". [PARAGRAPH:1]Los continuos avances de los blancos hacia el oeste se tradujeron en nuevos desplazamientos para los indios, y m&#225;s adelante en una serie de conflictos conocidos como las "guerras indias". Sin embargo, los indios nunca lograron unificarse lo suficiente para hacer frente a los europeos o sus descendientes. A lo largo de este proceso, se repiti&#243; una vez tras otra un mismo escenario. Las diferentes tribus luchaban por separado y a brazo partido contra los invasores, y eran casi derrotadas. Entonces se les convenc&#237;a de que firmaran un tratado, que normalmente era quebrantado alg&#250;n tiempo despu&#233;s por los blancos, y la tribu se ve&#237;a desplazada de nuevo a punta de bayoneta. El estado de Oklahoma se entreg&#243; originalmente a los indios a los que se hab&#237;a expulsado en el este, pero luego, en la d&#233;cada de 1890, se parcel&#243; para entreg&#225;rselo a colonos blancos. [PARAGRAPH:1]A comienzos del siglo XX, entre el 75 y el 95 por ciento de la poblaci&#243;n india hab&#237;a sido destruida por el hambre, la enfermedad o la guerra. El sistema de reservas hab&#237;a confinado a los supervivientes en tierras de mala calidad por todo el pa&#237;s, y en el transcurso de las d&#233;cadas siguientes, el alcoholismo y el suicidio se cebaron con ellos. Pero en la d&#233;cada de 1960 se inici&#243; un renacimiento de la cultura nativa americana. En nuestros d&#237;as, m&#225;s de dos millones de indios americanos viven distribuidos en unas 563 tribus por todos los Estados Unidos. Los escritores y poetas indios, como Sherman Alexie, han descrito de manera hermosa las penurias sufridas por sus hermanos, al tiempo que este pueblo orgulloso empezaba a emerger de las reservas para extenderse por los Estados Unidos.</Spanish>

		<English>The area which encompasses modern Portugal was originally settled by Celtic tribes around 1000 BC and was then subsequently conquered by the Visigoths and finally the Moors. The Christian Kings of Asturia eventually drove the Moors out of the area; the new nation of Portugal was formed after its separation from Spanish rule.[PARAGRAPH:1]Portugal was one of the first great internationally-based sea empires in the European world. Between 1415 and 1665, Portugal created a series of resting and refueling ports along the eastern and western coasts of Africa in a bid to eventually reach the profitable shores of India. In 1498 they achieved their goals when Vasco da Gama reached Kozhikode (known then as Calicut). Several important battles took place between the Arabs (who had previously monopolized spice trade in the Indian Ocean) and the Portuguese during this era, the most important of them being the victory over the Egyptian-Gujarati fleet off of Diu in 1509. This victory assured the Portuguese maritime superiority in the Indian Ocean and enabled them to capitalize on the rich spice trade routes between India and Europe. However, in 1578 King Sebastian of Portugal was killed at the battle of "Field of the Three Kings" in Morocco (which Portugal had long hoped to conquer), along with the majority of his force, destroying a central part of Portugal's land armies.[PARAGRAPH:1] In 1580 the throne of Portugal was given over to the Habsburg kings of Spain, partially a result of the Portuguese weakness after the demise of its own king. At the same time, Portuguese power in both the east and west was declining due to a lack of skilled sailors available in Portugal. The English and the Dutch had also been amassing large navies, and began expanding their spheres of influence along routes traditionally held solely by the Portuguese. Although the Portuguese wrested national control back from the Spanish in a 1640 revolt, they lost their control in Malacca, Ceylon, Cochin, Hormuz, among many others to the Dutch or other seafaring nations. With their eastern territories diminishing, Brazil, discovered by Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500, became increasingly important.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gold was discovered in Brazil in 1690, which had previously been exploited mostly for its dyewood, sugar, diamonds, tobacco and slaves. The ensuing gold rush boosted the population of Brazil from 200,000 in 1650 to 1.5 million in 1770. Brazil today remains the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1808, French troops under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal, forcing the prince regent, Dom Jo&#227;o, to flee to Brazil and set up a new government. In 1821, the royal family moved back to Portugal after reclaiming the country. Dom Jo&#227;o stayed behind, and then his son, Dom Pedro I, ruled Brazil until the country broke away from its mother country, declaring independence in 1822. [PARAGRAPH:1]After losing Brazil, Portugal focused on building its African acquisitions in order to compete with their British and French counterparts. However, after World War II, the majority of European nations began abandoning their outlying colonies. India forcibly retook the Portuguese colonies still in their territory. In 1974, a democratic government was established in Portugal. This new government negotiated the release of its African holdings, which were promptly devastated by civil war and vicious in-fighting generated by the Cold War.[PARAGRAPH:1]Today Portugal is ruled from its capital in Lisbon as a democratic republic under the constitution of 1976. It remains an important participant in the European Union as well as one of the major environmental reformers of Europe.</English>
		<French>La région qui comprend le Portugal moderne est initialement colonisée par des tribus celtiques aux alentours de 1 000 av. J.C. et elle est ensuite conquise par les Visigoths puis les Maures. Les rois catholiques des Asturies finissent par chasser les Maures de la région, et la nouvelle nation du Portugal est formée après sa séparation d'avec l'empire espagnol.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le Portugal est l'un des premiers grands empires maritimes du monde. Entre 1415 et 1665, le Portugal établit une série de ports de repos et de ravitaillement le long des côtes occidentales et orientales de l'Afrique, dans l'espoir d'atteindre les rives de l'Inde. En 1498, ils y parviennent quand Vasco de Gama rejoint Kozhikode (connue alors sous le nom de Calicut). Plusieurs grandes batailles ont lieu entre les Arabes (qui avaient déjà monopolisé le commerce des épices dans l'océan indien) et les Portugais pendant cette période, dont la plus importante se solde par la victoire portugaise sur la flotte égyptienne au large de Diu en 1509. Cette victoire assure la supériorité maritime portugaise dans l'océan indien et leur permet de tirer profit des riches routes commerciales entre l'Inde et l'Europe. Cependant, en 1578, le roi Sébastien de Portugal est tué lors de la bataille des Trois Rois, au Maroc (que le Portugal avait longtemps espéré conquérir), en même temps que la majeure partie de ses troupes, anéantissant une grande partie des troupes terrestres du Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:1] En 1580, le trône est concédé aux rois Habsbourg d'Espagne, en partie à cause de la faiblesse du Portugal après le décès de son roi. Au même moment, la puissance portugaise à l'est et à l'ouest décline en raison d'un manque de marins expérimentés au Portugal. Les Anglais et les Néerlandais ayant également constitué une marine importante, ils étendent leur sphère d'influence le long des routes traditionnellement exploitées par les Portugais. Même si ces derniers reprennent le contrôle national aux Espagnols en 1640, ils perdent Malacca, Ceylan, Cochin, Hormuz et bien d'autres au profit des Néerlandais et autres nations navales. Avec la diminution de leurs territoires orientaux, le Brésil, découvert par Pedro Alvares Cabral en 1500, prend une importance considérable.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1690, on découvre de l'or au Brésil, qui jusqu'ici avait surtout été exploité pour son bois de Pernambouc, son sucre, ses diamants, son tabac et ses esclaves. La ruée vers l'or qui s'ensuit fait passer la population brésilienne de 200 000 habitants en 1650 à 1,5 millions en 1770. Aujourd'hui encore, le Brésil demeure le plus grand pays de langue portugaise.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1808, les troupes françaises de Napoléon Bonaparte envahissent le Portugal, obligeant le prince régent, Jean VI, à fuir au Brésil et à instaurer un nouveau gouvernement. En 1821, la famille royale réclame à nouveau le trône et retourne au Portugal. Jean VI reste au Brésil et son fils Pierre IV régnera sur le Brésil jusqu'à ce que ce pays rompe avec le Portugal et déclare son indépendance en 1822. [PARAGRAPH:1]Après avoir perdu le Brésil, le Portugal s'efforce de renforcer ses acquisitions africaines afin qu'elles puissent rivaliser avec leurs rivales anglaises et britanniques. Néanmoins, après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, les nations européennes commencent à abandonner leurs colonies. L'Inde s'empare de force des colonies portugaises encore présentes sur son territoire. En 1974, un gouvernement démocratique est établi au Portugal. Ce nouveau gouvernement négocie la libération de ses territoires africains, rapidement dévastés par la guerre civile et les violentes querelles intestines générées par la guerre froide.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aujourd'hui, le Portugal est une république démocratique établie par la constitution de 1976 et le gouvernement siège à Lisbonne, sa capitale. Il reste un membre important de l'Union Européenne ainsi que l'un des principaux réformateurs européens en matière d'environnement.</French>
		<German>Das Gebiet des modernen Portugal wurde urspr&#252;nglich um 1000 v. Chr. von keltischen St&#228;mmen besiedelt und in der Folgezeit von den Westgoten und schlie&#223;lich den Mauren erobert. Die christlichen K&#246;nige von Asturien vertrieben die Mauren schlie&#223;lich; nach Erkl&#228;rung der Unabh&#228;ngigkeit von der spanischen Herrschaft entstand die neue Nation Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Portugal war eines der ersten auf einer Seemacht begr&#252;ndeten Reiche in Europa. Von 1415 bis 1665 gr&#252;ndete Portugal eine Reihe von Ruhe- und Versorgungsh&#228;fen entlang der afrikanischen Ost- und Westk&#252;ste, um endlich die profitablen K&#252;sten Indiens zu erreichen. 1498 erreichten sie ihr Ziel, als Vasco da Gama Kozhikode (damals Calicut) erreichte. In dieser Zeit fanden mehrere wichtige Schlachten zwischen den Arabern (die vorher das Monopol auf den Gew&#252;rzhandel im Indischen Ozean besessen hatten) und den Portugiesen statt, von denen die wichtigste der Sieg 1509 &#252;ber die &#196;gyptisch-Gujaratische Flotte vor Diu war. Dieser Sieg garantierte den Portugiesen die Seehoheit im Indischen Ozean und versetzte sie in die Lage, aus den reichen Gew&#252;rzhandelswegen zwischen Indien und Europa Kapital zu schlagen. 1578 wurde jedoch K&#246;nig Sebastian von Portugal in der Schlacht von Alcazarquivir in Marokko (das Portugal schon lange zu erobern gehofft hatte) get&#246;tet, zusammen mit dem Gro&#223;teil seiner Streitkr&#228;fte, und ein zentraler Teil der portugiesischen Landarmee war vernichtet.[PARAGRAPH:1]1580 wurde der portugiesische Thron an die habsburgischen K&#246;nige von Spanien &#252;bergeben, was teils auf die Schw&#228;che der Portugiesen nach dem Tod ihres eigenen K&#246;nigs zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren war. Gleichzeitig nahm die portugiesische Macht im Osten wie im Westen ab, da es in Portugal nicht gen&#252;gend f&#228;hige Seeleute gab. Die Engl&#228;nder und die Niederl&#228;nder hatten ebenfalls gewaltige Flotten gebaut und begannen, ihre Einflussbereiche entlang der Routen zu erweitern, die traditionell allein von den Portugiesen kontrolliert worden waren. Obwohl die Portugiesen 1640 durch einen Aufstand den Spaniern die Herrschaft wieder entrissen, verloren sie Malakka, Ceylon, Cochin, Hormuz und viele weitere Gebiete an die Niederl&#228;nder und andere Seefahrernationen. Durch den Schwund der Gebiete im Osten wurde das 1500 von Pedro Alvares Cabral entdeckte Brasilien immer wichtiger.[PARAGRAPH:1]1690 wurde in Brasilien, das vorher &#252;berwiegend f&#252;r Farbh&#246;lzer, Zucker, Diamanten, Tabak und Sklaven ausgebeutet worden war, Gold entdeckt. Der resultierende Goldrausch lie&#223; die Bev&#246;lkerung Brasiliens von 200.000 im Jahr 1650 auf 1,5 Millionen im Jahr 1770 anschwellen. Brasilien ist bis heute das gr&#246;&#223;te portugiesischsprachige Land der Welt.[PARAGRAPH:1]1808 eroberten franz&#246;sische Truppen unter Napoleon Bonaparte Portugal und zwangen den Prinzregenten, Dom Jo&#227;o, nach Brasilien zu fliehen, wo er eine neue Regierung einberief. 1821 kehrte die k&#246;nigliche Familie nach der R&#252;ckeroberung des Landes nach Portugal zur&#252;ck. Dom Jo&#227;o blieb zur&#252;ck, und nach ihm regierte sein Sohn Dom Pedro I. Brasilien, bis das Land 1822 die Verbindungen zum Mutterland l&#246;ste und sich unabh&#228;ngig erkl&#228;rte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Verlust Brasiliens konzentrierte sich Portugal darauf, seine afrikanischen Besitzt&#252;mer auszubauen, um mit ihren britischen und franz&#246;sischen Rivalen mithalten zu k&#246;nnen. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg gaben die meisten europ&#228;ischen Nationen jedoch ihre entfernten Kolonien auf. Indien nahm die auf indischem Gebiet befindlichen portugiesischen Kolonien gewaltsam wieder an sich. 1974 wurde in Portugal eine demokratische Regierung eingerichtet. Diese neue Regierung verhandelte &#252;ber die R&#252;ckgabe ihrer afrikanischen Besitzt&#252;mer, die prompt von B&#252;rgerkriegen und durch den Kalten Krieg hervorgerufene innere Auseinandersetzungen verw&#252;stet wurden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Heute wird Portugal von seiner Hauptstadt Lissabon aus als demokratische Republik unter der Verfassung von 1976 regiert. Das Land ist ein wichtiger Mitgliedsstaat der Europ&#228;ischen Union und einer der bedeutenden Umweltreformer in Europa.</German>
		<Italian>L'area che comprende il moderno Portogallo fu originariamente colonizzata da trib&#249; celtiche attorno al 1000 a.C. e fu successivamente conquistata dai Visigoti e dai Mori. I re cristiani di Asturia cacciarono infine i Mori dalla zona e, dopo la separazione dal dominio spagnolo, fu creata la nuova nazione del Portogallo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il Portogallo fu uno dei primi imperi marittimi internazionali del mondo europeo. Tra il 1415 e 1665, il Portogallo cre&#242; una serie di porti di sosta e approvvigionamento lungo le coste orientali e occidentali dell'Africa nel tentativo di raggiungere infine le proficue coste dell'India. Nel 1498 raggiunse l'obiettivo, quando Vasco da Gama arriv&#242; a Kozhikode (conosciuta allora come Calicut). In questo periodo ci furono importanti battaglie tra gli Arabi (che avevano precedentemente monopolizzato il commercio delle spezie nell'Oceano Indiano) e i Portoghesi, che vinsero la pi&#249; importante davanti alle coste di Diu, nel 1509. Questa vittoria assicur&#242; la superiorit&#224; portoghese nell'Oceano Indiano e permise ai Portoghesi di sfruttare il ricco commercio di spezie tra India ed Europa. Nel 1578, per&#242;, re Sebastiano di Portogallo fu ucciso nella Battaglia dei Tre Re in Marocco (che il Portogallo sperava di conquistare), assieme alla maggior parte del proprio esercito, causando la distruzione di una parte centrale delle forze di terra portoghesi.[PARAGRAPH:1] Nel 1580 il trono di Portogallo fu ceduto agli Asburgo, sovrani di Spagna, come risultato parziale della debolezza portoghese dopo la sconfitta del proprio re. Allo stesso tempo la potenza portoghese sia nell'est che nell'ovest era in declino a causa di una mancanza di abili marinai in Portogallo. Anche gli inglesi e gli olandesi avevano accumulato grandi flotte e cominciarono a espandere le proprie sfere di influenza lungo rotte tradizionalmente dominio esclusivo dei portoghesi. Anche se i portoghesi riuscirono a riprendere il controllo della propria nazione dagli spagnoli durante una rivolta nel 1640, persero il controllo di Malacca, Ceylon, Cochin, Hormuz e di molti altri porti a favore degli olandesi e di altre nazioni marittime. Con la diminuzione dei territori orientali il Brasile, scoperto nel 1500 da Pedro Alvares Cabral, divenne sempre pi&#249; importante.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel 1690 fu scoperto l'oro in Brasile, in precedenza sfruttato principalmente per legname, zucchero, diamanti, tabacco e schiavi. La corsa all'oro che ne scatur&#236; fece aumentare la popolazione del Brasile dai 200.000 nel 1650 a 1.5 milioni nel 1770. A oggi il Brasile rimane il Paese in cui si parla portoghese pi&#249; grande al mondo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel 1808 truppe francesi sotto il comando di Napoleone Bonaparte invasero il Portogallo, forzando il principe reggente, Dom Jo&#227;o, a fuggire in Brasile e a istituire un nuovo governo. Nel 1821, la famiglia reale torn&#242; in Portogallo dopo aver rivendicato il Paese. Dom Jo&#227;o rimase indietro e suo figlio, Dom Pedro I, regn&#242; in Brasile fino a quando il Paese si separ&#242; dalla madre patria, dichiarando l'indipendenza nel 1822. [PARAGRAPH:1]Dopo la perdita del Brasile, il Portogallo si concentr&#242; sui propri possedimenti africani, per competere con le controparti britannica e francese. Dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, per&#242;, la maggior parte delle nazioni europee cominci&#242; ad abbandonare le colonie pi&#249; lontane. L'India si riprese con la forza le colonie portoghesi ancora sul proprio territorio. Nel 1974 venne istituito in Portogallo un governo democratico che negozi&#242; la liberazione dei possedimenti africani, i quali vennero subito devastati dalla guerra civile e dalle lotte intestine generate dalla Guerra Fredda.[PARAGRAPH:1]Al giorno d'oggi il Portogallo &#232; una Repubblica democratica secondo la costituzione del 1976, con capitale a Lisbona. Rimane un importante membro dell'Unione Europea cos&#236; come uno dei maggiori riformatori ambientali d'Europa.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El &#225;rea que conforma el Portugal moderno fue originalmente colonizada por tribus celtas alrededor del a&#241;o 1000 a. C. y conquistada posteriormente por los visigodos y los musulmanes. Los reyes cristianos de Asturias expulsaron a los musulmanes de la zona, y Portugal se form&#243; como reino independiente de los dem&#225;s reinos peninsulares.[PARAGRAPH:1]Portugal fue uno de los primeros grandes imperios de base oce&#225;nica de la historia europea. Entre 1415 y 1665, los portugueses, en su af&#225;n por alcanzar las ricas tierras de la India, crearon una serie de estaciones de paso y avituallamiento a lo largo de las dos costas de &#193;frica, la oriental y la occidental. En 1498, este objetivo cristaliz&#243; con la llegada de Vasco de Gama a Kozhikode (conocida entonces como Calicut). En aquellos a&#241;os se produjeron varias batallas importantes entre los &#225;rabes (due&#241;os y se&#241;ores hasta entonces del monopolio del comercio de las especias en el &#205;ndico) y los portugueses, la m&#225;s importante de las cuales fue la victoria alcanzada por &#233;stos sobre la flota egipcio-gujarat&#237; en las proximidades de Diu (1509). Esta victoria asegur&#243; la supremac&#237;a portuguesa en el &#205;ndico y les permiti&#243; capitalizar el comercio de especias entre la India y Europa. Sin embargo, en 1578, el rey Sebasti&#225;n de Portugal cay&#243; muerto en la batalla del "Campo de los tres reyes" en Marruecos (cuya conquista Portugal codiciaba hac&#237;a tiempo), junto con la mayor parte de su ej&#233;rcito, descalabro que dej&#243; maltrechas las fuerzas terrestres del pa&#237;s.[PARAGRAPH:1] En 1580, el trono de Portugal recay&#243; en los Habsburgo de Espa&#241;a, en parte como consecuencia del debilitamiento portugu&#233;s tras la muerte de su rey. Al mismo tiempo, el poder de los portugueses en el este y el oeste declinaba por la ausencia de marineros capaces en el pa&#237;s. Tanto los ingleses como los holandeses, que hab&#237;an estado construyendo importantes armadas, empezaron a expandir sus respectivas esferas de influencia en rutas tradicionalmente reservadas a los portugueses. Aunque los portugueses se sacudieron de encima el yugo espa&#241;ol en la revuelta de 1640, en el proceso perdieron el control de Malaca, Ceil&#225;n, Coch&#237;n, y Ormuz (entre otros territorios) a manos de los holandeses y otras naciones marineras. La p&#233;rdida de los territorios orientales provoc&#243; un aumento equivalente de la importancia de Brasil, descubierto por Pedro Alvares Cabral en 1500.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1690 se encontr&#243; oro en Brasil, que hasta entonces se hab&#237;a explotado principalmente por el pernambuco, el az&#250;car, los diamantes, el tabaco y los esclavos. La fiebre del oro que se desencaden&#243; entonces provoc&#243; un aumento en la poblaci&#243;n de la colonia, que pas&#243; de 200.000 habitantes en 1650 a 1,5 millones en 1770. En la actualidad, Brasil sigue siendo el pa&#237;s de habla portuguesa m&#225;s grande del mundo.[PARAGRAPH:1]En 1808, las tropas francesas de Napole&#243;n Bonaparte invadieron Portugal y obligaron al pr&#237;ncipe regente, Don Juan (Jo&#227;o), a huir a Brasil para establecer un gobierno en el exilio.

		<English>The Sumerian Empire was founded along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in modern day Iraq, in roughly 3000 BC. Sumeria was the world's first civilization and created the world's first historians through the invention of cuneiform, the original written language. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Sumerian people were organized into a series of carefully irrigated city-states, each with its own ruler and local deities. The surplus of wheat grown from the verdant fertility of the Tigris and Euphrates allowed the Sumerians to create an exceptional urban civilization. Never numbering more than a dozen or so, the cities of Sumeria were major centers of commerce, culture and defense, and the Sumerians were the first truly metropolitan population. In fact, the Sumerian creation myth states that first there was nothing; then there was a city - Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sumerian cities were seas of sun-cooked brick, rushing irrigation ditches and mountainous ziggurats (the Sumerian temples to the gods). Facing near-constant warfare, each city was defined by a series of intimidating walls and well-placed canals. Indeed, the Sumerians are the first people known to employ a professional army, necessary to fight the perpetual skirmishes that characterized Sumerian daily life.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unity in Sumeria was only established at the end of a spear. The first Sumerian King to lay claim over a number of cities was Eannatum of Lagash. Initiating a campaign against the city of Umma (Lagash's ancient rival) over a border dispute, Eannatum followed up his victory by sweeping over and conquering the remainder of Sumeria. An uprising within Umma would later shatter this new empire, but a mutual treaty would again bring peace to Sumeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Sumerians were not alone in the Fertile Crescent. Their competitors included the Akkadians, a Semetic people to the North. In 2334 BC, Sargon, a highly skilled military strategist, was born in Akkadia. Upon reaching maturity, Sargon would found his own dynasty - the Akkadians - bringing all the peoples of the Fertile Crescent, including the Sumerians, under his rule.[PARAGRAPH:1]In roughly 2250 BC, a new people, the Gutians, thundered into the Fertile Crescent, deposing the Akkadians and establishing themselves as the new rulers of the land. But the rigors of invasion severely weakened the new overlords of Mesopotamia, allowing the long-dominated Sumerians the chance for rebellion. With the rise of a new leader, Utu-khegal, the Sumerians threw off their Gutian overlords and reestablished the supremacy of Sumerian culture throughout the Fertile Crescent.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under Ur-Nammu, a successor of Utu-khegal, order was restored in the fractured state, and the period of The Third Dynasty of Ur began. Ur-Nammu was a reformer and builder as well as a warrior, and he created roads and walls throughout his new empire. This golden age would last until 2004 BC, when internal feuding fractured the Sumerian nation decisively.[PARAGRAPH:1]The story of Sumeria comes to us through the many cuneiform tablets that have been discovered. Unfortunately, many of these tablets aren't especially evocative: tireless record-keepers, the Sumerians would just as often record the season's flock of sheep as the reign of ancient kings. Several tablets, though, have been of a religious nature and have provided great insights into the foundation of Judeo-Christian beliefs. Tales of a great flood abound in Sumerian myth. Man, they said, was formed from clay.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the first great empire vanished from history, Sumerian culture would survive to influence the next great civilization to spring from the Tigris-Euphrates Valley - Babylon.</English>
		<French>L'empire sum&#233;rien se trouve sur les rives du Tigre et de l'Euphrate, au sein de l'Irak moderne, vers 3000 av. J.C. Le Sumer est la premi&#232;re civilisation mondiale et cr&#233;e les premiers historiens du monde gr&#226;ce &#224; l'invention du cun&#233;iforme, l'un des premiers langages &#233;crits.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Sum&#233;riens sont organis&#233;s en une s&#233;rie de villes soigneusement irrigu&#233;es, chacune avec son propre chef et divinit&#233;s locales. L'exc&#233;dent de bl&#233; cultiv&#233; sur les rives fertiles du Tigre et de l'Euphrate permet aux Sum&#233;riens de cr&#233;er une exceptionnelle civilisation urbaine. Les villes sum&#233;riennes, qui ne seront jamais plus d'une dizaine environ, sont d'importants centres commerciaux, culturels et d&#233;fensifs et les Sum&#233;riens constituent la premi&#232;re population r&#233;ellement m&#233;tropolitaine. D'ailleurs, le mythe sum&#233;rien de la cr&#233;ation proclame qu'au premier jour, il n'y avait rien, puis qu'apparut une cit&#233; : Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les villes sum&#233;riennes sont construites en terre cuite, avec des foss&#233;s d'irrigation et d'immenses ziggourats (temples sum&#233;riens d&#233;di&#233;s aux dieux). Presque constamment en guerre, chaque ville est gard&#233;e par d'impressionnantes murailles et des canaux plac&#233;s &#224; des endroits strat&#233;giques. D'ailleurs, les Sum&#233;riens sont les premiers &#224; employer une arm&#233;e professionnelle, pour lutter contre les querelles perp&#233;tuelles au Sumer.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'unit&#233; sum&#233;rienne n'a pu &#234;tre &#233;tablie qu'au bout d'une lance. Eannatum de Lagash est le premier roi sum&#233;rien &#224; avoir des pr&#233;tentions sur plusieurs villes. Apr&#232;s avoir men&#233; campagne contre la cit&#233; d'Umma (l'ancienne rivale de Lagash) pour une question de fronti&#232;res, Eannatum entreprend de conqu&#233;rir le reste du Sumer. Une r&#233;volte au sein d'Umma d&#233;truira son nouvel empire, mais un trait&#233; mutuel ram&#232;nera la paix.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cependant, les Sum&#233;riens ne sont pas seuls dans le Croissant fertile. Parmi leurs principaux rivaux se trouvent les Akkadiens, peuple s&#233;mitique du nord. En 2334 av. J.C., Sargon, un talentueux strat&#232;ge, na&#238;t en Akkadie. Sargon fonde sa propre dynastie, les Akkadiens, et place tous les peuples du Croissant fertile sous son commandement.[PARAGRAPH:1]Vers 2250 av J.C. un nouveau peuple, les Gutis, envahit le Croissant fertile, d&#233;tr&#244;ne les Akkadiens et s'&#233;tablit en dirigeant de la r&#233;gion. Mais les rigueurs de l'invasion affaiblissent gravement les nouveaux chefs de la M&#233;sopotamie et permettent aux Sum&#233;riens de se rebeller. Apr&#232;s l'av&#232;nement d'un nouveau chef, Utu-khegal, les Sum&#233;riens chassent les Gutis et r&#233;tablissent la supr&#233;matie de la culture sum&#233;rienne au sein du Croissant fertile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sous Ur-Nammu, successeur d'Utu-khegal, l'ordre est restaur&#233; dans l'Etat divis&#233; et l'&#232;re de la Troisi&#232;me dynastie d'Ur commence. Ur-Nammu est un r&#233;formateur, un b&#226;tisseur et un guerrier et il cr&#233;e de nombreuses routes et murailles &#224; travers son nouvel empire. Cet &#226;ge d'or durera jusqu'en 2004 av. J.C., quand des querelles internes provoquent la fin de la nation sum&#233;rienne.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'histoire du Sumer nous est parvenue gr&#226;ce &#224; la d&#233;couverte de nombreuses tablettes cun&#233;iformes. Malheureusement, nombre de ces tablettes ne sont pas sp&#233;cialement &#233;vocatrices : infatigables archivistes, les Sum&#233;riens notaient avec autant de z&#232;le le nombre de moutons que le r&#232;gne des anciens rois. Plusieurs tablettes sont tout de m&#234;me de nature religieuse et ont fourni de pr&#233;cieuses informations sur la fondation des croyances jud&#233;o-chr&#233;tiennes. On trouve par exemple de nombreux r&#233;cits de grand d&#233;luge. Et la mythologie sum&#233;rienne affirme que l'homme avait &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233; &#224; partir d'argile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bien que le premier grand empire ait disparu de l'Histoire, la culture sum&#233;rienne allait survivre pour influencer la prochaine grande civilisation de la vall&#233;e du Tigre et de l'Euphrate : Babylone.</French>
		<German>Das Sumerische Reich wurde entlang der Ufer der Fl&#252;sse Euphrat und Tigris gegr&#252;ndet, im heutigen Irak, ungef&#228;hr 3000 v. Chr. Sumer war die erste Zivilisation der Welt und brachte durch die Erfindung der Keilschrift, der urspr&#252;nglichen Schriftsprache, die ersten Historiker der Welt hervor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Volk von Sumer war in einer Reihe sorgf&#228;ltig bew&#228;sserter Stadtstaaten organisiert, von denen jeder seinen eigenen Herrscher und eigene Lokalgottheiten hatte. Der &#220;berschuss an Weizen, der auf den fruchtbaren Feldern an Euphrat und Tigris wuchs, erm&#246;glichte es den Sumerern, eine au&#223;ergew&#246;hnliche st&#228;dtische Zivilisation zu erschaffen. Obwohl sie nie mehr als ungef&#228;hr ein Dutzend z&#228;hlten, waren die sumerischen St&#228;dte bedeutende Zentren des Handels, der Kultur und der Verteidigung, und die Sumerer bildeten die erste echte Stadtbev&#246;lkerung. Tats&#228;chlich besagt der sumerische Sch&#246;pfungsmythos, dass am Anfang das Nichts war und dann eine Stadt - Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sumerische St&#228;dte waren Meere aus sonnengebrannte Ziegel, brausenden Bew&#228;sserungsgr&#228;ben und berghohen Zikkuraten (sumerische G&#246;ttertempel). Angesichts beinahe stetig andauernder Kriege war jede Stadt von einer Reihe furchteinfl&#246;&#223;ender Mauern und gut platzierter Kan&#228;le umgeben. In der Tat waren die Sumerer das erste Volk, von dem bekannt ist, dass es eine Berufsarmee einsetzte, welche die ewigen Scharm&#252;tzel ausfocht, die kennzeichnend f&#252;r das allt&#228;gliche Leben in Sumer waren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eintracht entstand in Sumer nur durch die Spitze eines Speers. Der erste sumerische K&#246;nig, der mehrere St&#228;dte beanspruchte, war Eannatum von Lagasch. Eannatum begann anl&#228;sslich eines Grenzstreits einen Feldzug gegen die Stadt Umma (Lagaschs uralten Rivalen) und lie&#223; seinem Sieg den &#220;berfall auf und die Eroberung des restlichen Sumers folgen. Ein Aufstand in Umma sollte sp&#228;ter sein neues Reich zerschmettern, doch ein wechselseitiger Vertrag w&#252;rde Sumer erneut Frieden schenken.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Sumerer waren jedoch im Fruchtbaren Halbmond nicht allein. Zu ihren Konkurrenten geh&#246;rten die Akkader, ein semitisches Volk im Norden. 2334 v. Chr. wurde Sargon, ein &#228;u&#223;erst begabter Milit&#228;rstratege, in Akkad geboren. Nach Erlangen der Mannesreife sollte Sargon seine eigene Dynastie gr&#252;nden - die Akkader - und alle V&#246;lker des Fruchtbaren Halbmonds, darunter die Sumerer, unter seine Herrschaft bringen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ungef&#228;hr 2250 v. Chr. brach ein neues Volk, die Gut&#228;er, &#252;ber den Fruchtbaren Halbmond herein, setzte die Akkader ab und etablierte sich selbst als die neuen Herren des Landes. Doch die H&#228;rten der Invasion schw&#228;chten die neuen Herren Mesopotamiens rasch, und gaben den lang unterdr&#252;ckten Sumerern die M&#246;glichkeit zur Rebellion. Mit dem Aufstieg ihres neuen Anf&#252;hrers, Utu-Khegal, &#252;berwarfen die Sumerer ihre gut&#228;ischen Herren und stellten die Vorherrschaft der sumerischen Kultur im gesamten Fruchtbaren Halbmond wieder her.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unter Ur-Nammu, einem Nachfolger Utu-Khegals, wurde in dem zersplitterten Staat wieder f&#252;r Ordnung gesorgt und es begann die Epoche der Dritten Dynastie von Ur. Ur-Nammu war ebenso Reformer und Erbauer wie Krieger und schuf in seinem gesamten neuen Reich Stra&#223;en und Mauern. Dieses Goldene Zeitalter sollte bis 2004 v. Chr. andauern, als innere K&#228;mpfe die Nation der Sumerer entscheidend spalteten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Geschichte Sumers ist uns durch die vielen entdeckten Keilschrifttafeln &#252;berliefert. Leider sind viele dieser Tafeln nicht sehr vielsagend. Als unerm&#252;dliche Chronisten zeichneten die Sumerer ebenso oft die Anzahl Schafe in einer bestimmten Jahreszeit auf wie die Herrschaft antiker K&#246;nige. Mehrere Tafeln haben jedoch einen religi&#246;sen Hintergrund und haben gro&#223;artige Einblicke in das Fundament des j&#252;disch-christlichen Glaubens geliefert. Geschichten &#252;ber eine gro&#223;e Flut sind in sumerischen Mythen im &#220;berfluss vorhanden. Der Mensch, so hei&#223;t es, wurde aus Lehm geformt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obwohl das erste gro&#223;e Reich aus der Geschichte verschwunden ist, sollte die sumerische Kultur &#252;berleben und die n&#228;chste gro&#223;e Zivilisation beeinflussen, die sich aus dem Tal des Euphrat und Tigris erheben sollte - Babylon.</German>
		<Italian>L'Impero Sumero nacque sulle rive dei fiumi Tigri ed Eufrate, sui territori dell'odierno Iraq, attorno al 3000 a.C. La Sumeria fu la prima civilt&#224; del mondo che port&#242; alla nascita dei primi storici al mondo tramite l'invenzione del primo linguaggio scritto, ovvero la scrittura cuneiforme. [PARAGRAPH:1]I Sumeri erano organizzati in una serie di irrigue citt&#224;-stato, ognuna con il proprio governatore e divinit&#224; locali. Il frumento in eccesso ottenuto grazie alla fertilit&#224; del Tigri e dell'Eufrate permise ai Sumeri di creare un'eccezionale civilt&#224; urbana. Mai pi&#249; di una dozzina, le citt&#224;-stato dei Sumeri erano grossi centri commerciali, culturali e di difesa, e i Sumeri furono la prima vera popolazione metropolitana. Infatti la mitologia della creazione sumera racconta che prima non c'era nulla, e poi ci fu la prima citt&#224;: Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le citt&#224; sumere erano distese di mattoni cotti dal sole, canali d'irrigazione e montagnose Ziggurat (i templi sumeri alle divinit&#224;). Per far fronte al continuo stato di guerra, ogni citt&#224; era delimitata da possenti mura e canali ben sistemati. Addirittura, i Sumeri furono la prima popolazione a utilizzare un esercito professionale, indispensabile per combattere i continui scontri che caratterizzavano la vita quotidiana.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'unit&#224; della Sumeria poteva essere raggiunta solamente con la punta di una lancia. Il primo re sumero a rivendicare potere su pi&#249; citt&#224; fu Eannatum di Lagash. Dopo aver iniziato la campagna contro la citt&#224; di Umma (l'antica rivale di Lagash) a causa di una disputa sui confini, Eannatum segu&#236; lo slancio della propria vittoria e conquist&#242; il resto della Sumeria. Una rivolta di Umma spezz&#242; pi&#249; tardi in due il neonato impero, ma un trattato congiunto port&#242; di nuovo la pace in Sumeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Sumeri per&#242; non erano i soli ad abitare la "mezzaluna fertile". Fra i loro concorrenti ci sono gli Accadiani, un popolo semita a nord. Nel 2334 a.C. in Accadia nacque Sargon, un abile stratega militare. Quando raggiunse la maturit&#224;, Sargon fond&#242; la propria dinastia, quella degli Accadiani, portando sotto il proprio dominio tutte le genti della mezzaluna fertile, inclusi i Sumeri.[PARAGRAPH:1]Attorno al 2250 a.C. una nuova popolazione, i Gutiani, si fece strada in Mesopotamia, deponendo gli Accadiani e imponendosi come nuovi signori di quella terra. Ma i rigori dell'invasione avevano seriamente indebolito i nuovi dominatori della mezzaluna fertile, dando ai Sumeri la possibilit&#224; di ribellarsi. &#200; con l'avvento di un nuovo capo, Utu-khegal, che i Sumeri si liberano dei dominatori gutiani e ristabiliscono la supremazia della cultura sumera nell'intera mezzaluna fertile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sotto Ur-Nammu, successore di Utu-khegal, venne ristabilito l'ordine nella nazione divisa e cominci&#242; il periodo della Terza Dinastia di Ur. Ur-Nammu fu un riformatore e un costruttore, oltre che un guerriero, e cre&#242; strade e mura in tutto il suo nuovo impero. Questo periodo particolarmente favorevole sarebbe durato fino al 2004 a.C., quando i conflitti intestini divisero definitivamente la nazione sumera.[PARAGRAPH:1]La storia della Sumeria c'&#232; arrivata attraverso la scrittura cuneiforme sulle molte tavolette ritrovate. Sfortunatamente molte di queste non sono particolarmente evocative: i Sumeri amavano archiviare tutto, tanto il numero di pecore in una stagione quanto il regno di antichi re. Molte tavolette erano per&#242; di natura religiosa e c'hanno fornito una grande comprensione delle fondamenta della fede giudeo-cristiana. Racconti di una grande inondazione abbondano tra i miti sumeri e l'uomo, dicevano, era stato creato con l'argilla.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante il primo grande impero sia svanito nella storia, la cultura sumera sarebbe sopravvissuta all'influenza della successiva grande civilt&#224; nata nella valle del Tigri e dell'Eufrate: Babilonia.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El imperio de S&#250;mer se fund&#243; en las orillas del Tigris y el &#201;ufrates, en el moderno Irak, hacia el a&#241;o 3000 a. C. S&#250;mer fue la primera civilizaci&#243;n del mundo y, gracias a la invenci&#243;n de la escritura cuneiforme, leg&#243; los primeros historiadores a la humanidad. [PARAGRAPH:1]El pueblo sumerio estaba formado por una serie de ciudades-estado cuidadosamente irrigadas, cada una de ellas con su propio gobernante y sus propias deidades locales. Los excedentes de trigo que produc&#237;an las llanuras aluviales del Tigris y el &#201;ufrates permitieron a los sumerios crear una excepcional civilizaci&#243;n urbana. Las ciudades de S&#250;mer (nunca m&#225;s de una docena en total) eran important&#237;simos centros de cultura y defensa, y sus habitantes formaron las primeras poblaciones urbanas del mundo. De hecho, los mitos sumerios sobre la creaci&#243;n afirmaban que no exist&#237;a nada hasta que apareci&#243; la primera ciudad, Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Las ciudades sumerias eran mares de ladrillos de arcilla cocida al sol, caudalosos canales de irrigaci&#243;n y colosales ziggurats (los templos sumerios a sus dioses). Cada una de ellas, sumidas en un estado de guerra casi constante, estaba definida por una serie de imponentes murallas y canales estrat&#233;gicamente situados. De hecho, los sumerios fueron los primeros en utilizar un ej&#233;rcito profesional, necesario para librar las constantes escaramuzas que caracterizaban la vida cotidiana en la regi&#243;n.[PARAGRAPH:1]En S&#250;mer, la unidad solo se obten&#237;a por la fuerza. El primer rey sumerio que logr&#243; gobernar sobre varias ciudades fue Eannatum de Lagash. Tras una primera campa&#241;a victoriosa contra la ciudad de Umma (la rival ancestral de Lagash) por una disputa fronteriza, Eannatum conquist&#243; la totalidad de S&#250;mer. M&#225;s tarde, un levantamiento en Umma destruir&#237;a el joven imperio, pero un tratado de paz firmado al poco tiempo volver&#237;a a traer la paz a S&#250;mer.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sin embargo, los sumerios no estaban solos en el Creciente f&#233;rtil. Entre sus rivales se encontraban los acadios, un pueblo semita del norte. Sarg&#243;n, un destacado estratega militar, naci&#243; en Acadia en el a&#241;o 2334 a. C. Tras llegar a la madurez, Sarg&#243;n fund&#243; su propia dinast&#237;a, los acadios, que logr&#243; reunir bajo su autoridad a todos los pueblos del Creciente f&#233;rtil, sumerios incluidos.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hacia el a&#241;o 2250 a. C., un nuevo pueblo, los gutios, irrumpieron en el Creciente f&#233;rtil, vencieron a los acadios y se establecieron como nuevos amos de la regi&#243;n. Pero la invasi&#243;n cost&#243; muy cara a los nuevos amos de Mesopotamia, y dio a los sumerios la ocasi&#243;n de rebelarse contra el yugo que tanto tiempo hab&#237;an soportado. Unidos bajo un nuevo l&#237;der, Utu-khegal, los sumerios expulsaron a sus amos gutios y restablecieron su supremac&#237;a cultural por todo el Creciente f&#233;rtil.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durante el reinado de Ur-Nammu, uno de los sucesores de Utu-khegal, se restaur&#243; el orden en el seno del fracturado estado sumerio, y se inaugur&#243; el per&#237;odo conocido como Tercera dinast&#237;a de Ur. Ur-Nammu, reformador y constructor adem&#225;s de soldado, construy&#243; caminos y murallas por todo su nuevo imperio. Esta edad de oro durar&#237;a hasta el a&#241;o 2.004 a. C., cuando las disputas intestinas volvieron a fracturar gravemente la naci&#243;n sumeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]La historia de S&#250;mer ha llegado hasta nosotros en numerosas tablillas con inscripciones en cuneiforme. Por desgracia, muchas de estas fuentes no son especialmente evocadoras: incansables archivistas, los sumerios consignaban del mismo modo las cabezas de ganado nacidas en una estaci&#243;n que los reinados de sus monarcas. Sin embargo, se han encontrado numerosas tablillas de naturaleza religiosa que han aportado mucha luz sobre el nacimiento de las creencias judeocristianas. En los mitos sumerios, abundan los relatos sobre una gran inundaci&#243;n. Y en ellos se dice que el hombre se cre&#243; a partir de la arcilla.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aunque el primer gran imperio acab&#243; desvaneci&#233;ndose de la historia, la cultura sumeria continuar&#237;a irradi&#225;ndose sobre las civilizaciones posteriores desde el valle del Tigris y el &#201;ufrates, es decir, desde Babilonia.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar or different types of crops in the same area in sequenced seasons. It is done so that the soil of farms is not used for only one set of nutrients. It helps in reducing soil erosion and increases soil fertility and crop yield. Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row disproportionately depletes the soil of certain nutrients. With rotation, a crop that leaches the soil of one kind of nutrient is followed during the next growing season by a dissimilar crop that returns that nutrient to the soil or draws a different ratio of nutrients. In addition, crop rotation mitigates the buildup of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped, and can also improve soil structure and fertility by increasing biomass from varied root structures. Crop cycle is used in both conventional and organic farming systems.</English>
